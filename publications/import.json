Whales had body temperatures within mammalian range and maintained a skin-water temperature difference of about 2° C. Heat-loss coefficients were less than that reported for humans. Thermal conductance may be greater than or equal to small cetaceans and humans. The larger killer whales had smaller surface-area-to-volume ratios than the belugas, as expected. However, the largest whales of each species had a greater surface area devoted to the appendages. Respiratory evaporative energy losses were small owing to expired air that was cooler than core temperature and that was unsaturated with water vapor. Basal or resting metabolic rate was higher than expected for animals of their body weight. The best-fit regression equation for our data was metabolic rate = {\\$}0.88 mass{\\^{}}{\\{}1.06{\\}}{\\$}.

Based on a combination of gross pathology, histopathology, bacterial isolation, and toxin testing, Clostridium difficile enterocolitis was diagnosed. Most pups were anorexic or inappetant and died acutely with few other premonitory signs. Due to ongoing clinical concerns and possible emergence of this pathogen at the facility, efforts to better characterize the disease and understand the epidemiology of C. difficile was initiated in 95 harbor seal pups presented for rehabilitation in a single stranding season. Fecal samples were collected on admission, following completion of antibiotic treatment, and also prerelease or postmortem.

Although Hg in most freshwater fish from northern Canada was not sufficiently elevated to be of concern, a few lakes in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut contained fish of certain species (e.g. northern pike, Arctic char) whose muscle Hg concentrations exceeded an estimated threshold range (0.5–1.0$\\mu$gg-1 wet weight) within which adverse biological effects begin to occur. Marine fish species generally had substantially lower Hg concentrations than freshwater fish; but the Greenland shark, a long-lived predatory species, had mean muscle Hg concentrations exceeding the threshold range for possible effects on health or reproduction. An examination of recent egg Hg concentrations for marine birds from the Canadian Arctic indicated that mean Hg concentration in ivory gulls from Seymour Island fell within the threshold range associated with adverse effects on reproduction in birds. Mercury concentrations in brain tissue of beluga whales and polar bears were generally lower than levels associated with neurotoxicity in mammals, but were sometimes high enough to cause subtle neurochemical changes that can precede overt neurotoxicity. Harbour seals from western Hudson Bay had elevated mean liver Hg concentrations along with comparatively high muscle Hg concentrations indicating potential health effects from methylmercury (MeHg) exposure on this subpopulation. Because current information is generally insufficient to determine with confidence whether Hg exposure is impacting the health of specific fish or wildlife populations in the Canadian Arctic, biological effects studies should comprise a major focus of future Hg research in the Canadian Arctic. Additionally, studies on cellular interactions between Hg and selenium (Se) are required to better account for potential protective effects of Se on Hg toxicity, especially in large predatory Arctic fish, birds, and mammals.}, author = {Scheuhammer, Anton and Chan, Hing Man and Frouin, H{\\'{e}}lo{\\\"{i}}se and Krey, Anke and Letcher, Robert and Loseto, Lisa and No{\\\"{e}}l, Marie and Ostertag, Sonja and Ross, Peter and Wayland, Mark}, doi = {10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2014.05.142}, issn = {0048-9697}, journal = {Science of The Total Environment}, month = {mar}, pages = {91--103}, publisher = {Elsevier}, title = {{Recent progress on our understanding of the biological effects of mercury in fish and wildlife in the Canadian Arctic}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714008341}, volume = {509-510}, year = {2015}}"

Microplastics concentrations ranged from 8 to 9200particles/m3; lowest concentrations were in offshore Pacific waters, and increased 6, 12 and 27-fold in west coast Vancouver Island, Strait of Georgia, and Queen Charlotte Sound, respectively. Fibres accounted for ∼75{\\%} of particles on average, although nearshore samples had more fibre content than offshore (p0.05). While elevated microplastic concentrations near urban areas are consistent with land-based sources, the high levels in Queen Charlotte Sound appeared to be the result of oceanographic conditions that trap and concentrate debris.

PhHV-1–associated pathology was first recognized in harbor seal carcasses submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada in 2000, and 63 cases were identified by 2008. A review of these cases indicated that PhHV-1–associated disease is widespread in harbor seals in the wild and within rehabilitation facilities in the coastal northeastern Pacific (including British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, USA). Morbidity and mortality occurred primarily in neonatal and weanling seal pups, and was due to PhHV-1 alone, or in combination with other disease processes.

These chemical tracers—stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen; persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations, patterns and ratios; and fatty acid profiles—were measured in blubber biopsy samples from North Pacific killer whales (Orcinus orca) (n=84) and were used to provide further insight into their diet, particularly for the offshore group, about which little dietary information is available. The offshore killer whales were shown to consume prey species that were distinctly different from those of sympatric resident and transient killer whales. In addition, it was confirmed that the offshores forage as far south as California. Thus, these results provide evidence that the offshores belong to a third killer whale ecotype. Resident killer whale populations showed a gradient in stable isotope profiles from west (central Aleutians) to east (Gulf of Alaska) that, in part, can be attributed to a shift from off-shelf to continental shelf-based prey. Finally, stable isotope ratio results, supported by field observations, showed that the diet in spring and summer of eastern Aleutian Island transient killer whales is apparently not composed exclusively of Steller sea lions.}, author = {Krahn, Margaret M. and Herman, David P. and Matkin, Craig O. and Durban, John W. and Barrett-Lennard, Lance and Burrows, Douglas G. and Dahlheim, Marilyn E. and Black, Nancy and LeDuc, Richard G. and Wade, Paul R.}, doi = {10.1016/J.MARENVRES.2006.07.002}, issn = {0141-1136}, journal = {Marine Environmental Research}, month = {mar}, number = {2}, pages = {91--114}, publisher = {Elsevier}, title = {{Use of chemical tracers in assessing the diet and foraging regions of eastern North Pacific killer whales}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113606001656}, volume = {63}, year = {2007}}"

The northeastern Pacific is home to two distinct ecotypes of killer whales, Orcinus orca, called residents and transients. Resident killer whales feed on fish, a prey with poor hearing abilities, whereas transient killer whales hunt marine mammals, which have sensitive underwater hearing within the frequency range of killer whale vocal communication. In this study, we investigated how the superior hearing ability of mammalian prey has shaped the vocal behaviour of the transient killer whale ecotype. We recorded pulsed calls and the associated behavioural context of groups of transient and resident killer whales in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. Transient killer whales produced pulsed calls significantly less frequently than residents. Transient killer whales only showed significant amounts of vocal behaviour after a marine mammal kill or when the whales were displaying surface-active behaviour. Vocal activity of transients increased after a successful attack on a marine mammal. Since marine mammals are able to detect killer whale pulsed calls and respond with antipredator behaviour, the reduced vocal activity of transients is probably due to a greater cost for calling in this ecotype resulting from eavesdropping by potential prey. The increase in vocal behaviour after a successful attack may represent food calling (informing other animals in the area about the presence of food), but is more likely to reflect an increase in social interactions during feeding and/or the fact that the cost for vocal behaviour is comparatively low after a successful attack.}, author = {Deecke, Volker B. and Ford, John K.B. and Slater, Peter J.B.}, doi = {10.1016/J.ANBEHAV.2004.04.014}, issn = {0003-3472}, journal = {Animal Behaviour}, month = {feb}, number = {2}, pages = {395--405}, publisher = {Academic Press}, title = {{The vocal behaviour of mammal-eating killer whales: communicating with costly calls}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347204004026}, volume = {69}, year = {2005}}"

We analysed two call types made by two matrilineal social groups of resident killer whales, Orcinus orca, over 12–13 years. We used a neural network-based index of acoustic similarity to identify mechanisms of call differentiation. A test for structural modification of the calls detected significant changes in one call type in both groups, but not in the other. For the modified call type, the rate of divergence between the two groups was significantly lower than the rate of modification within either group showing that calls were modified in a similar fashion in the two groups. An analysis of structural parameters detected no strong directionality in the change. The pattern of call modification could have been caused by maturational changes to the calls or, if killer whale dialects are learned behavioural traits, cultural drift in the structure of the calls together with horizontal transmission of modifications between the two groups. Such vocal matching between members of different matrilines would suggest that vocal learning is not limited to vertical transmission from mother to offspring, which has important implications for models of gene–culture coevolution.}, author = {Deecke, V.B and Ford, J.K.B and Spong, P}, doi = {10.1006/ANBE.2000.1454}, issn = {0003-3472}, journal = {Animal Behaviour}, month = {nov}, number = {5}, pages = {629--638}, publisher = {Academic Press}, title = {{Dialect change in resident killer whales: implications for vocal learning and cultural transmission}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347200914544?{\\_}rdoc=1{\\&}{\\_}fmt=high{\\&}{\\_}origin=gateway{\\&}{\\_}docanchor={\\&}md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb}, volume = {60}, year = {2000}}"

When cultural lineages also reflect common ancestry and/or are shared by individuals that live together they are called clans. The existence of clans among killer whales has been previously proposed but has not been confirmed. Here, we show that clans exist among resident type killer whales, Orcinus orca, in southern Alaska. Resident killer whales live in stable matrilines from which emigration of either sex has not been observed. Matrilines that associate regularly (≥50{\\%} observation time) are called pods. Pods are believed to consist of closely related matrilines and share a unique repertoire of discrete call types. Pods that share parts of their repertoire form what Ford (1991, Canadian Journal of Zoology,69, 1454–1483) called an acoustic clan. Here, we identified discrete call types of seven pods from southern Alaska, using a method based on human discrimination of distinct aural and visual (spectrogram) differences. Mitochondrial DNA of members of each pod was also analysed. The repertoires of the seven pods were compared and two acoustically distinct groups of pods were identified. Each group was monomorphic for a different mitochondrial D-loop haplotype. Nevertheless, pods from different clans associated frequently. It thus appears that the acoustic similarities within groups, which we presume to be cultural, reflect common ancestry, and that these groups therefore meet the above definition of clans. We also argue that a combination of cultural drift and selection are the main mechanisms for the maintenance of clans. Copyright 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Detailed life history information for the fish-eating `resident' population, comprising two distinct communities, and the marine mammal-eating `transient' killer whale population, provided an invaluable reference for the interpretation of contaminant concentrations. Total PCB concentrations (sum of 136 congeners detected) were surprisingly high in all three communities, but transient killer whales were particularly contaminated. PCB concentrations increased with age in males, but were greatly reduced in reproductively active females. The absence of age, sex and inter-community differences in concentrations of polychlorinated- dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and- dibenzofurans (PCDFs) may have partly reflected low dietary levels, but more importantly, metabolic removal of dioxin-like compounds in killer whales. While information on toxic thresholds does not exist for PCBs in cetaceans, total 2,3,7,8-TCDD Toxic Equivalents (TEQ) in most killer whales sampled easily surpassed adverse effects levels established for harbour seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging killer whales in this region are at risk for toxic effects.

These distinctions have been attributed to apparent differences in diet, although no comprehensive comparative analysis of the diets of the two forms had been undertaken. Here we present such an analysis, based on field observations of predation and on the stomach contents of stranded killer whales collected over a 20-year period. In total, 22 species of fish and 1 species of squid were documented in the diet of resident-type killer whales; 12 of these are previously unrecorded as prey of O. orca. Despite the diversity of fish species taken, resident whales have a clear preference for salmon prey. In field observations of feeding, 96{\\%} of fish taken were salmonids.

Here, the patterns of echolocation sounds produced by killer whales,Orcinus orca, off British Columbia and Alaska are described. Two sympatric populations with divergent food habits differed markedly in sonar sound production. Individuals belonging to the fish-eating ‘resident' population produced trains of characteristic sonar clicks, on average, 4{\\%} of the time, 27 times more often than marine mammal-eating ‘transient' killer whales. The click trains of residents averaged 7s, more than twice as long as the trains of transients. Click repetition rates within resident's trains were constant or changed gradually; within transient's trains they often fluctuated abruptly. Transients produced isolated single or paired clicks at an average rate of 12/h, four times as often as residents. In general, the isolated clicks and infrequent, short and irregular trains of transients were less conspicuous against background noise than the sonar of residents. This difference in acoustic crypticity may reflect a flexible response to the probability of alerting prey, because marine mammals have more acute hearing than fish in the frequency range of sonar clicks. In both populations, echolocation use per individual decreased with increasing group size, suggesting the sharing of information between group members. No relationships were found between echolocation activity and water clarity for whales of either population. Transient whales often travelled or foraged without discernibly echolocating, suggesting that passive listening provides cues for prey detection and orientation.}, author = {BARRETT-LENNARD, LANCE G. and FORD, JOHN K.B. and HEISE, KATHY A.}, doi = {10.1006/ANBE.1996.0059}, issn = {0003-3472}, journal = {Animal Behaviour}, month = {mar}, number = {3}, pages = {553--565}, publisher = {Academic Press}, title = {{The mixed blessing of echolocation: differences in sonar use by fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347296900597}, volume = {51}, year = {1996}}"

Male gonads develop at a faster rate than female gonads initially, and reach maximum size about two months prior to females.

Ripe gonad weight increased with body size; mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) of ripe females was 47.7{\\%}, and potential fecundity averaged 26 500 eggs. At the time when ripe females started to spawn, some females were still unripe (GSI = 20.2{\\%}). Their eggs were not hydrated, and these fish had significantly higher levels of sex steroids (estradiol, 11-ketotestosterone, and testosterone) in their blood than ripe fish. Arctic cod are repeat spawners, at least under laboratory conditions, in spite of the large amount of energy allocated to reproduction (306 kJ lost from liver and muscle during gonadal development and 125 kJ as eggs during spawning).

Pods each produced 7–17 (mean 10.7) types of discrete calls. Individuals appear to acquire their pod's call repertoire by learning, and repertoires can persist with little change for over 25 years. Call repertoires differed significantly among pods in the resident population. The 16 pods formed four distinct acoustic associations, or clans, each having a unique repertoire of discrete calls, or vocal tradition. Pods within a clan shared several call types, but no sharing took place among clans. Shared calls often contained structural variations specific to each pod or group of pods in the clan.

Red blood cell pHi was not preferentially regulated, and there was no evidence of RBC swelling or nucleoside triphosphate adjustment. Although there were no changes in arterial O2 levels during hypercapnia, ventilation immediately increased 2.7-fold through large changes in stroke volume and small changes in frequency, and declined only slightly through 24–48 h. PaCO2 equilibrated rapidly with PICO2, driving down arterial pHa, which was 65{\\%} corrected through HCO3− accumulation by 24 h. In contrast, the extradural fluid outside the brain equilibrated only very slowly, and was clearly not involved in the ventilatory stimulation.

Physiol., 1990, 80: 251–270). Skate were sampled for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acid-base status, intracellular pH of the brain (14C-DMO method), and pHi in other tissues throughout 24 h of exposure to PiCO2 = 7.5 Torr. CSF PCO2 rapidly equilibrated with the elevated PaCO2. Despite the much lower non-HCO3−1 buffer capacity in the CSF, CSF pH was not depressed to the same extent as blood pHa. CSF pH was also regulated more rapidly, returning to control levels by 8–10 h, whereas pHa remained significantly depressed at 24 h. Similarly, the pHis of the weakly buffered brain and heart ventricle were initially compensated more rapidly than those of more strongly buffered white muscle and red blood cells. However, brain pHi adjustment slowed markedly after 4 h and stabilized at only 70{\\%} compensation by 20–24 h, suggesting that brain intracellular acidosis may play a role in the long-term increase in ventilation. CSF and brain were the only compartments which did not exhibit an apparent compounding metabolic acidosis during the initial stages of hypercapnic exposure. While these results illustrate the primacy of central acid-base regulation, they do not support a role for CSF pH in the long-term elevation of ventilation in response to hypercapnia.

The threshold oxygen tension of the perfusate was between 25 and 46 Torr (3.33–6.13 kPa) for maintaining resting and maximum cardiac ouput, but was between 46 and 67 Torr (6.13 – 8.93 kPa) for maintaining maximum power output.

The whales produced three types of sounds that were assumed to be social signals: discrete calls, variable calls, and aberrant calls. Discrete calls dominated vocalization in most contexts. An increase in production of variable and aberrant calls was observed during socializing and beach-rubbing activities.

Between 2007 and 2012, 1,696 whole carcasses, tissue samples, or both were submitted from the northeastern Pacific and Arctic Canada for diagnostic testing.

This report represents the first known multidisciplinary team approach to emergency laparotomy in a compromised, 22-yr-old, female Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). The inciting clinical signs and ancillary diagnostics were consistent with a mechanical ileus. Although no torsion or obstruction was apparent during surgery, severe enteritis and peritonitis were noted. Postoperatively, the animal was maintained on aggressive medical management with continuous supportive care until succumbing 3 days later with clinical pathology indicative of terminal sepsis and profound inflammation. Postmortem findings included generalized vascular stasis and segmental intestinal volvulus with infarction. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the most-complex surgical and anesthetic procedures performed in a cetacean.

Pressure differentials could arise from ventral compression on each fluke downstroke or by a faster equilibration of the abdominal compartment with changing ambient ocean pressures compared with the thoracic compartment. If significant pressure differentials do develop, we would expect the morphology of the diaphragm to adapt to its in vivo loading. Here, we tested the hypothesis that significant pressure differentials develop between the thoracic and abdominal cavities in diving cetaceans by examining diaphragms from several cetacean and pinniped species. We found that: (1) regions of cetacean diaphragms possess subserosal collagen fibres that would stabilize the diaphragm against craniocaudal stretch; (2) subserosal collagen covers 5-60{\\%} of the thoracic diaphragm surface, and area correlates strongly with published values for swimming speed of each cetacean species (P0.001); and (3) pinnipeds, which do not locomote by vertical fluking, do not possess this subserosal collagen. These results strongly suggest that this collagen is associated with loads experienced during a dive, and they support the hypothesis that diving cetaceans experience periods during which abdominal pressures significantly exceed thoracic pressures. Our results are consistent with the generation of pressure differentials by fluking and by different compartmental equilibration rates. Pressure differentials during diving would affect venous and arterial perfusion and alter transmural pressures in abdominal arteries.}, author = {Lillie, Margo A and Vogl, A Wayne and Raverty, Stephen and Haulena, Martin and McLellan, William A and Stenson, Garry B and Shadwick, Robert E}, doi = {10.1242/jeb.162289}, file = {::}, issn = {1477-9145}, journal = {The Journal of experimental biology}, keywords = {Cardiovascular,Collagen,Diving adaptations,Diving mammal,Fluking,Morphology}, month = {oct}, number = {Pt 19}, pages = {3464--3477}, pmid = {28978638}, publisher = {The Company of Biologists Ltd}, title = {{Controlling thoracic pressures in cetaceans during a breath-hold dive: importance of the diaphragm.}}, url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978638}, volume = {220}, year = {2017}}"

Archival satellite transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally into four rehabilitated California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and 15 wild juvenile Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) to determine the viability of this surgical technique for the deployment of long-term telemetry devices in otariids. The life history transmitters record information throughout the life of the host and transmit data to orbiting satellites after extrusion following death of the host. Surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia and single (n = 4) or dual (n = 15) transmitters were inserted into the ventrocaudal abdominal cavity via an 8.5 to 12 cm incision along the ventral midline between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis or preputial opening. Surgeries lasted 90 minutes (SD = 8) for the 19 sea lions. All animals recovered well and were released into the wild after extended monitoring periods from 27 to 69 days at two captive animal facilities. Minimum post-implant survival was determined via post-release tracking using externally attached satellite transmitters or via opportunistic re-sighting for mean durations of 73.7 days (SE = 9.0, Z. californianus) and 223.6 days (SE = 71.5, E. jubatus). The low morbidity and zero mortality encountered during captive observation and post-release tracking periods confirm the viability of this surgical technique for the implantation of long-term telemetry devices in otariids.}, author = {Horning, Markus and Haulena, Martin and Tuomi, Pamela A and Mellish, Jo-Ann E}, doi = {10.1186/1746-6148-4-51}, file = {::}, issn = {1746-6148}, journal = {BMC Veterinary Research}, keywords = {Transgenics,Veterinary Medicine,Zoology}, month = {dec}, number = {1}, pages = {51}, publisher = {BioMed Central}, title = {{Intraperitoneal implantation of life-long telemetry transmitters in otariids}}, url = {http://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-4-51}, volume = {4}, year = {2008}}"

Evidence from Lago Amana suggests almost seven months of fasting. Manatees may eat dead vegetative matter of both autochthonous and allochthonous origin, relying on hindgut fermentation to derive nutritive value from such material. It is suggested that the extremely low metabolic rate (36{\\%} of standard) and the large quantity of blubber may represent critical adaptations in the survival of this species during prolonged dry seasons. It may be calculated that a fat manatee may survive up to 200 days before exhausting its lipid reserves.}, author = {Best, Robin C.}, doi = {10.2307/2388000}, issn = {00063606}, journal = {Biotropica}, month = {mar}, number = {1}, pages = {61}, publisher = {Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation}, title = {{Apparent Dry-Season Fasting in Amazonian Manatees (Mammalia: Sirenia)}}, url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/2388000?origin=crossref}, volume = {15}, year = {1983}}"

Pulse series having irregular repetition rates resemble the echolocation clicks of captive delphinids, and it is suggested that they serve a similar purpose. Pulse series having regular changes in repetition rate and distinct aural tones probably serve as social signals. The regular recurrence of a number of recognizably distinct pulsed tones suggests that the narwhal has 'signature' calls similar to several other odontocetes.}, author = {Ford, John K.

In Canada, threatened aquatic species were less likely than terrestrial species to be listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), the main legal instrument for bestowing protection, in the early years of the Act's implementation. In this paper, the existence of economic thresholds that might have hampered the protection of Canadian marine and freshwater fishes is examined. The analysis of the socio-economic data used to inform listing decisions about threatened fish taxa over the past decade reveals that the likelihood of being listed declines non-linearly with increasing estimated costs of protection but does not vary with proposed threat status. The estimated threshold cost (i.e., the point at which the likelihood of not being listed=0.5) was {\\~{}}{\\$}5,000,000 ({\\~{}}{\\$}1,400,000 to {\\~{}}{\\$}31,400,000, 95{\\%} CI) per decade for freshwater species but only {\\~{}}{\\$}90,000 ({\\$}{\\~{}}50,000 to {\\~{}}{\\$}140,000, 95{\\%} CI) per decade for marine fish taxa. In fact, no marine fish species with an anticipated cost of listing greater than zero was listed for protection. The presence of existing management legislation and qualitative statements about negative impacts of listing on exploitation generally led to denying protection to marine but not to freshwater species. These findings highlight both a large and inconsistent emphasis on costs of protection in SARA listing decisions, to the detriment of marine fish species. {\\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}, author = {Schultz, Jessica A. and Darling, Emily S. and C{\\^{o}}t{\\'{e}}, Isabelle M.}, doi = {10.1016/j.marpol.2013.01.021}, isbn = {0308-597X}, issn = {0308597X}, journal = {Marine Policy}, keywords = {Aquatic conservation,Conservation legislation,Cost-benefit analysis,Endangered species,Marine conservation policy}, pages = {125--132}, title = {{What is an endangered species worth?

In 2000, a further 184 sea lions stranded with similar clinical signs, but the strandings occurred both during detectable algal blooms and after the blooms had subsided. The clinical signs in these 265 Californian sea lions included seizures, ataxia, head weaving, decreased responsiveness to stimuli and scratching behaviour. Affected animals had high haematocrits, and eosinophil counts, and high activities of serum creatine kinase. They were treated supportively by using fluid therapy, diazepam, lorazepam and phenobarbitone. Fifty-five of the 81 sea lions (68 per cent) affected in 1998 and 81 of the 184 (44 per cent) affected in 2000 died despite the treatment. Three of the 23 sea lions which survived in 1998 were tracked with satellite and radiotransmitters; they travelled as far south as San Miguel Island, California, and survived for at least three months. Eleven of the 129 animals which were released stranded within four months of being released.}, author = {Gulland, F M D and Haulena, M and Fauquier, D and Langlois, G and Lander, M E and Zabka, T and Duerr, R}, doi = {10.1136/VR.150.15.475}, journal = {The Veterinary record}, month = {apr}, number = {15}, pages = {475--80}, pmid = {11995679}, publisher = {British Medical Journal Publishing Group}, title = {{Domoic acid toxicity in Californian sea lions (Zalophus californianus): clinical signs, treatment and survival.}}, url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11995679}, volume = {150}, year = {2002}}"

Surgical excision revealed the subcutaneous mass to be covered in haired skin with multiple glabrous areas and structures resembling a jaw with tooth buds, eyelids, and a tail. The mass deformed the host pup's skull. Histologic examination revealed a complete vertebra in the tail, teeth in the jaw, and areas resembling tongue and larynx. Class 1 MHC sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the mass and the host twin were identical. The mass was diagnosed as a fetus in fetu, a rare congenital anomaly in which 1 conjoined twin is completely enclosed in the body of the other twin. The host pup died, and no additional defects were found; however, blubber levels of persistent organic pollutants were high. The cause of the congenital anomaly in this pup is uncertain.}, author = {Buckles, E. L. and Gulland, F. M. D. and Aldridge, B. M. and Gelatt, T. S. and Ross, P. S. and Haulena, M. and Lowenstine, L.

By investigating the hormonal mechanisms of the somatotropic axis that link nutrition, fat metabolism, and lean tissue accretion, we can assess the physiological impact of decreased nutrient intake on growth. Further, species that undergo seasonal periods of reduced intake as a part of their normal life history may have a differential seasonal response to nutrient restriction. This experiment evaluated the influence of season and age on the response of the somatotropic axis, including growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, and IGF- binding proteins (BP), to reduced nutrient intake and re-alimentation in Steller sea lions. Eight captive females (five juveniles, three sub-adults) were subject to 28-day periods of food restriction, controlled re-feeding, and ad libitum recovery in summer (long-day photoperiod) and winter (short-day photoperiod). Hormone concentrations were insensitive to type of fish fed (low fat pollock vs. high fat herring), but sensitive to energy intake. Body mass, fat, and IGF-I declined, whereas GH and IGFBP-2 increased during feed restriction. Reduced IGF-I and IGFBP with increased GH during controlled re-feeding suggest that animals did not reach positive energy balance until fed ad libitum. Increased IGF-I, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and reduced GH observed in summer reflected seasonal differences in energy partitioning. There was a strong season and age effect in the response to restriction and re-alimentation, indicating that older, larger animals are better able to cope with stress associated with energy deficit, regardless of season.}, author = {Richmond, J P and {Jeanniard du Dot}, T and Rosen, David A S and Zinn, S A}, journal = {Journal of Experimental Zoology}, pages = {144--156}, title = {{Seasonal influence on the response of the somatotropic axis to nutrient restriction and re-alimentation in captive Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus)}}, volume = {313A}, year = {2010}}"

Sixty percent more fish and cephalopod prey were identified by morphological analyses of hard parts compared with DNA analysis of soft parts (hard parts identified higher relative proportions of Ammodytes sp., Cottidae, and certain Gadidae). DNA identified 213 prey occurrences, of which 75 (35{\\%}) were undetected by hard parts (mainly Salmonidae, Pleuronectidae, Elasmobranchii, and Cephalopoda), and thereby increased species occurrences by 22{\\%} overall and species richness in 44{\\%} of cases (when comparing 110 scats that amplified prey DNA). Prey composition was identical within only 20{\\%} of scats. Overall, diet composition derived from both identification techniques combined did not differ significantly from hard-part identification alone, suggesting that past scat-based diet studies have not missed major dietary components. However, significant differences in relative diet contributions across scats (as identified using the two techniques separately) reflect passage rate differences between hard and soft digesta material and highlight certain hypothesized limitations in conventional morphological-based methods (e.g., differences in resistance to digestion, hard part regurgitation, partial and secondary prey consumption), as well as potential technical issues (e.g., resolution of primer efficiency and sensitivity and scat subsampling protocols). DNA analysis of salmon occurrence (from scat soft-part matrix and 238 archived salmon hard parts) provided species-level taxonomic resolution that could not be obtained by morphological identification and showed that Steller sea lions were primarily consuming pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Notably, DNA from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that likely originated from a distant fish farm was also detected in two scats from one site in the eastern Aleutian Islands. Overall, molecular techniques are valuable for identifying prey in the fecal remains of marine predators. Combining DNA and hard-part identification will effectively alleviate certain predicted biases and will ultimately enhance measures of diet richness, fisheries interactions (especially salmon-related ones), and the ecological role of pinnipeds and other marine predators, to the benefit of marine wildlife conservationists and fisheries managers.}, author = {Tollit, D J and Schulze, A D and Trites, A W and Olesiuk, P F and Crockford, S J and Gelatt, T S and Ream, R R and Miller, K M}, journal = {Ecological Applications}, number = {4}, pages = {889--905}, title = {{Development and application of DNA techniques for validating and improving pinniped diet estimates}}, volume = {19}, year = {2009}}"

We validated a fecal glucocorticoid assay for this species with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Feces were collected from captive Steller sea lions (two males and two females) for 2 days before injection with ACTH, and for 4 or more days postinjection. Feces were freeze-dried, extracted with a methanol vortex method, and assayed for glucocorticoids. The assay demonstrated good parallelism and accuracy. All animals showed the expected peak of fecal glucocorticoid excretion after ACTH injection. However, the two males had higher baselines, higher peaks, and more delayed peaks than the females. Peak glucocorticoid excretion occurred at 5 and 28 h postinjection for the two females, and at 71 and 98 h for the two males. Correction for recoveries by the addition of tritiated hormones produced ACTH profiles that were virtually identical in pattern to uncorrected data, but with higher within-sample coefficients of variation. Based on these results, we conclude that this fecal glucocorticoid assay accurately reflects endogenous adrenal activity of Steller sea lions, and that recovery corrections are not necessary for this species when using the methanol vortex extraction method. More research is needed to address possible sex differences and other possible influences on fecal glucocorticoid concentrations.}, author = {Hunt, K E and Trites, A W and Wasser, S K}, journal = {Physiology and Behavior}, keywords = {Stress physiology {\\&} cortsiol}, mendeley-tags = {Stress physiology {\\&} cortsiol}, pages = {595--601}, title = {{Validation of a fecal glucocorticoid assay for Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus)}}, volume = {80}, year = {2004}}"

Eight animals were randomly divided into two experimental groups fed isocaloric diets: Group H ate Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) throughout the experiment while Group P was switched to walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) during a 28-day food restriction (after a 28-day baseline) and back to herring during a 28-day controlled re-feeding. Diet type did not impact the rates of body mass lost when food was restricted, but did influence the type of internal energy reserve (protein vs. lipids) the sea lions predominantly used. In both summer and winter, Group H lost significantly more lipids and less lean mass than Group P that was fed pollock during the restriction phase. The response of Group H was consistent with the predicted pattern of nutritional stress physiology (i.e. protein sparing and utilization of lipid reserves). Group P lost a surprisingly high proportion of body protein while consuming restricted levels of pollock, which could lead to muscle impairment and vital organ failure on a long-term basis. When given increased amounts of herring during the controlled re-feeding phase, the capacity of both groups to compensate for the previous mass loss was found to depend on season and was independent of previous diet. All of the sea lions increased their rates of mass gain and returned to their pre-experimental weight during winter, but not during summer. Some intrinsic energetic plasticity related to seasonal adaptation to the environment may render winter an easier period than summer to recover from nutritional stress.}, author = {{Jeanniard du Dot}, T and Rosen, D A S and Trites, A W}, journal = {Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology}, number = {1}, pages = {1--10}, title = {{Steller sea lions show diet-dependent changes in body composition during nutritional stress and recover more easily from mass loss in winter than in summer}}, volume = {367}, year = {2008}}"

During a period of energy restriction, one group of sea lions was fed reduced amounts of Pacific herring and another was fed an isocaloric diet of walleye pollock, after which both groups returned to their pre-experimental diets of herring. Cortisol was negatively and IGF-I was positively associated with changes in body mass during periods of energy restriction (mass loss associated with increase in cortisol and decrease in IGF-I) and refeeding (body mass maintenance associated with stable hormone concentrations in summer and compensatory growth linked to decrease in cortisol and increase in IGF-I in winter). Cortisol and IGF-I were also correlated with changes in lipid and lean mass, respectively. Consequently, these two hormones likely make adequate biomarkers for nutritional stress in sea lions, and when combined provide indication of the energetic strategy (lipid vs lean mass catabolism) animals adopt to cope with changes in nutrient intake.

The metabolic cost of each dive event (dive+surface interval; DMR) was measured using flow-through respirometry. The respiratory exchange ratio (VO2/VCO2) was significantly lower during spontaneous trials compared with conditioned trials. DMR was significantly higher during spontaneous trials and decreased exponentially with dive duration. A similar decrease in DMR was not as evident during conditioned trials. DMR could not be accurately estimated from the surface interval (SI) following individual dives that had short SIs (50 s), but could be estimated on a dive by dive basis for longer SIs (50 s). DMR decreased by 15{\\%}, but did not differ significantly from surface metabolic rates (MRS) when dive duration increased from 1 to 7 min. Overall, these data suggest that DMR is almost the same as MRS, and that Steller sea lions incur an O2 debt during spontaneous diving that is not repaid until the end of the dive bout. This has important consequences in differentiating between the actual and `apparent' metabolic rate during diving, and may explain some of the differences in metabolic rates reported in pinniped species.}, author = {Fahlman, A L and Svard, C and Rosen, D A S and Jones, D R and Trites, A W}, journal = {Journal of Experimental Biology}, pages = {3573--3580}, title = {{Metabolic costs of foraging and the management of O2 and CO2 stores in Steller sea lions}}, volume = {211}, year = {2008}}"

Isotopic analysis of vibrissae (whiskers) is a potentially useful approach to resolving the nutritional ecology of this species because long-term (up to 8 yr) dietary information is sequentially recorded and metabolically inert once formed. Additionally, vibrissae are grown in utero/i, potentially offering indirect inference on maternal diet. However, diet reconstruction using isotopic techniques requires a priori/i knowledge of trophic enrichment factors (TEFs), which can vary relative to diet quality and among animal species. In this study, we provide new TEF estimates for (1) maternal relative to pup vibrissae during both gestation and nursing and (2) adult vibrissae relative to a complex diet. Further, we refine vibrissa-milk TEFs based on an additional 76 animals with an age distribution ranging from 1 to 20 mo. Mother-pup vibrissae TEF values during gestation and nursing were near zero for {\\&}delta;sup13/supC and averaged 0.8 and 1.6{\\&}{\\#}x2030;, respectively, for {\\&}delta;sup15/supN.

There was a high degree of variability in ASSR thresholds among subjects; thresholds covered a range of {\\~{}}40 dB at each tested frequency. As expected, ASSR thresholds were elevated relative to previously reported psychophysical thresholds for California and Steller sea lions. The features of high-frequency hearing limit and relative sensitivity of most ASSR audiograms were, however, similar to those of psychophysical audiograms, suggesting that ASSR methods can be used to improve understanding of hearing demographics in sea lions, especially with respect to high-frequency hearing.

Sea lions were trained to dive to fixed depths of 10 to 50 m, and to  re-surface inside a floating dome to measure energy expenditure via gas exchange. A 3-axis  accelerometer was attached to the sea lions during foraging. Acceleration data were used to deter-  mine the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), a proxy for activity. Results showed that ODBA  correlated well with the diving metabolic rate (dive + surface interval) and that the variability in the  relationship (r2 = 0.47, linear regression including Sea lion as a random factor) was similar to that  reported for other studies that used heart rate to estimate metabolic rate for sea lions swimming  underwater in a 2 m deep water channel. A multivariate analysis suggested that both ODBA and dive  duration were important for predicting diving metabolic cost, but ODBA alone predicted foraging  cost to within 7{\\%} between animals. Consequently, collecting 3-dimensional acceleration data is a  simple technique to estimate field metabolic rate of wild Steller sea lions and other diving mammals  and birds.  }, author = {Fahlman, A L and Wilson, R P and Svard, C and Rosen, D A S and Trites, A W}, journal = {Aquatic Biology}, pages = {75--84}, title = {{Activity and diving metabolism correlate in Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus}}, volume = {2}, year = {2008}}"

Captive feeding trials were used to further test the technique with newly weaned harbour seals Phoca vitulina richardsi (N = 21). Two groups of seals were fed monotypic diets of either Pacific herring Clupea pallasii or surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus for 42 d while a third group was fed smelt for 21 d followed by herring for 21 d. Blubber biopsies were taken dorsally at Days 0, 21 and 42. Specific calibration coefficients (CC) used by QFASA were developed from 4 juvenile harbour seals and in some cases differed by 2-fold with previously reported phocid CC values. The QFASA diet estimates were evaluated using 2 CC sets, 15 FA subsets and a library of 3 to 11 potential prey species. Diet switches were best tracked using the harbour seal CC and the new FA subset. Overall prey misclassifications were apparent (mean = 12{\\%}, range = 4 to 25{\\%}) when modeled with 8 additional prey not fed, a trend consistent with overlapping prey FA signatures. Blubber FA turnover rates were not strictly linear and in the order of 1.5 to 3 mo in newly weaned seals. Following parameter optimization of the model, QFASA estimates reflected major diet trends in the feeding study, but were sensitive to the CC and FA subsets used as well as to prey spe- cies with similar FA signatures. Our results have important implications in the application of QFASA to the study of pinniped diets with more complex feeding histories and wider prey fields.}, annote = {- Following parameter optimization of the model, QFASA estimates reflected major diet trends in the feeding study, but were sensitive to the CC and FA subsets used as well as to prey spe- cies with similar FA signatures.}, author = {Nordstrom, C A and Wilson, L J and Iverson, S J and Tollit, D J}, journal = {Marine Ecology Progress Series}, keywords = {diet identification,fatty acids}, pages = {245--263}, title = {{Evaluating quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) using harbour seals Phoca vitulina richardsi in captive feeding studies}}, volume = {360}, year = {2008}}"

The disease leads to behavioral changes, lesions, loss of turgor, limb autotomy, and death characterized by rapid degradation (\"melting\"). Here, we present evidence from experimental challenge studies and field observations that link the mass mortalities to a densovirus (Parvoviridae). Virus-sized material (i.e., 0.2 $\\mu$m) from symptomatic tissues that was inoculated into asymptomatic asteroids consistently resulted in SSWD signs whereas animals receiving heat-killed (i.e., control) virus-sized inoculum remained asymptomatic. Viral metagenomic investigations revealed the sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV) as the most likely candidate virus associated with tissues from symptomatic asteroids. Quantification of SSaDV during transmission trials indicated that progression of SSWD paralleled increased SSaDV load. In field surveys, SSaDV loads were more abundant in symptomatic than in asymptomatic asteroids. SSaDV could be detected in plankton, sediments and in nonasteroid echinoderms, providing a possible mechanism for viral spread. SSaDV was detected in museum specimens of asteroids from 1942, suggesting that it has been present on the North American Pacific Coast for at least 72 y. SSaDV is therefore the most promising candidate disease agent responsible for asteroid mass mortality.}, author = {Hewson, Ian and Button, Jason B and Gudenkauf, Brent M and Miner, Benjamin and Newton, Alisa L and Gaydos, Joseph K and Wynne, Janna and Groves, Cathy L and Hendler, Gordon and Murray, Michael and Fradkin, Steven and Breitbart, Mya and Fahsbender, Elizabeth and Lafferty, Kevin D and Kilpatrick, A Marm and Miner, C Melissa and Raimondi, Peter and Lahner, Lesanna and Friedman, Carolyn S and Daniels, Stephen and Haulena, Martin and Marliave, Jeffrey and Burge, Colleen A and Eisenlord, Morgan E and Harvell, C Drew}, doi = {10.1073/pnas.1416625111}, journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}, keywords = {sea star wasting}, mendeley-tags = {sea star wasting}, month = {dec}, number = {48}, pages = {17278--83}, pmid = {25404293}, publisher = {National Academy of Sciences}, title = {{Densovirus associated with sea-star wasting disease and mass mortality.}}, url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25404293}, volume = {111}, year = {2014}}"

To gain insight into ensuing mechanisms that might alter indirect species interactions, we examined how behavioural responses to an upper-level predatory fish might differ between mesopredator species with different life histories. In rocky reefs of the northeast Pacific Ocean, adult lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are upper-level predators that use a sit-and-wait hunting mode. Reef mesopredators that are prey to adult lingcod include kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), younger lingcod, copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and quillback rockfish (S. maliger). Across these mesopredators species, longevity and age at maturity increases and, consequently, the annual proportion of lifetime reproductive output decreases in the order just listed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of risk taken to acquire resources would vary interspecifically in that same order. During field experiments we manipulated predation risk with a model adult lingcod and used fixed video cameras to quantify interactions between mesopredators and tethered prey (Pandalus shrimps). We predicted that the probabilities of inspecting and attacking tethered prey would rank from highest to lowest and the timing of these behaviours would rank from earliest to latest as follows: kelp greenling, lingcod, copper rockfish, and quillback rockfish. We also predicted that responses to the model lingcod, such as avoidance of interactions with tethered prey, would rank from weakest to strongest in the same order. Results were consistent with our predictions suggesting that, despite occupying similar trophic levels, longer-lived mesopredators with late maturity have stronger antipredator responses and therefore experience lower foraging rates in the presence of predators than mesopredators with faster life histories. The corollary is that the fishery removal of top predators, which relaxes predation risk, could potentially lead to stronger increases in foraging rates for mesopredators with slower life histories.}, author = {Frid, Alejandro and Marliave, Jeff and Heithaus, Michael R.}, doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0040083}, isbn = {1932-6203}, issn = {19326203}, journal = {PLoS ONE}, number = {6}, pages = {1--8}, pmid = {22768226}, title = {{Interspecific variation in life history relates to Antipredator decisions by marine mesopredators on temperate reefs}}, volume = {7}, year = {2012}}"

Due to the time costs of handling very large prey it may be optimal for gape-limited predatory fishes to select prey with body depths that are less than or equal to 60{\\%} of predator gape width. We tested for inverse relationships between the abundances of different sized rockfish (prey) and of lingcod (predator) large enough to be expected to select that rockfish size. We predicted that these relationships would be stronger when assuming that body depth of selected prey is less than or equal to 60{\\%}, rather than less than or equal to 100{\\%}, of lingcod gape width. Results were consistent with this prediction for small and medium size classes of rockfish. Regardless of prey selection assumptions there were no negative relationships between lingcod and large size classes of rockfish, possibly because only 2.3{\\%} of observed lingcod were large enough to select large rockfish when assuming prey body depth selection of less than or equal to 60{\\%} of predator gape width. Large rockfish, therefore, may have occupied a size refuge from lingcod risk. Our results, however, are characterized by large statistical uncertainty. We suggest that prey antipredator behaviour, which has the cost of reducing access to resources and the benefit of lowering mortality rates, might explain much of this uncertainty. Quillback and copper rockfish are long-lived species with late maturity. As such, they are expected to maximize fitness by investing heavily in antipredator behaviour, and this investment may have weakened numerical relationships between lingcod and small and medium size classes.}, author = {Frid, A. and Connors, B. and Cooper, A.

A total of 462 remote skin biopsies were collected from wild killer whales primarily between 2001 and 2010 from the northern Gulf of Alaska to the Sea of Okhotsk, representing both the piscivorous \"resident\" and the mammal-eating \"transient\" (or Bigg's) killer whales. Divergence of the 2 ecotypes was supported by both mtDNA and microsatellites. Geographic patterns of genetic differentiation were supported by significant regions of genetic discontinuity, providing evidence of population structuring within both ecotypes and corroborating direct observations of restricted movements of individual whales. In the Aleutian Islands (Alaska), subpopulations, or groups with significantly different mtDNA and microsatellite allele frequencies, were largely delimited by major oceanographic boundaries for resident killer whales. Although Amchitka Pass represented a major subdivision for transient killer whales between the central and western Aleutian Islands, several smaller subpopulations were evident throughout the eastern Aleutians and Bering Sea.

In this study we investigated geographical variation in monophonic and biphonic calls among four resident populations from the North Pacific Ocean: Northern and Southern residents from British Columbia and Washington State, southern Alaska residents, and eastern Kamchatka residents. We tested predictions generated by the hypothesis that call variation across populations is the result of an accumulation of random errors and innovation by vertical cultural transmission. Call frequency contours were extracted and compared using a dynamic time-warping algorithm. We found that the diversity of monophonic calls was substantially higher than that of biphonic calls for all populations. Repertoire diversity appeared to be related to population size: in larger populations, monophonic calls were more diverse and biphonic calls less diverse. We suggest that the evolution of both monophonic and biphonic calls is caused by an interaction between stochastic processes and directional selection, but the relative effect of directional selection is greater for biphonic calls. Our analysis revealed no direct correlation between call repertoire similarity and geographical distance. Call diversity within predefined call categories, types and subtypes, showed a high degree of correspondence between populations. Our results indicate that dialect evolution is a complex process influenced by an interaction among directional selection, horizontal transmission and founder effects.

We used a small, unmanned hexacopter to collect exhaled breath condensate (blow) from two geographically distinct populations of apparently healthy humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sampled in the Massachusetts coastal waters off Cape Cod (n = 17) and coastal waters around Vancouver Island (n = 9). Bacterial and archaeal small-subunit rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced from blow samples, including many of sparse volume, as well as seawater and other controls, to characterize the associated microbial community. The blow microbiomes were distinct from the seawater microbiomes and included 25 phylogenetically diverse bacteria common to all sampled whales. This core assemblage comprised on average 36{\\%} of the microbiome, making it one of the more consistent animal microbiomes studied to date. The closest phylogenetic relatives of 20 of these core microbes were previously detected in marine mammals, suggesting that this core microbiome assemblage is specialized for marine mammals and may indicate a healthy, noninfected pulmonary system. Pathogen screening was conducted on the microbiomes at the genus level, which showed that all blow and few seawater microbiomes contained relatives of bacterial pathogens; no known cetacean respiratory pathogens were detected in the blow. Overall, the discovery of a shared large core microbiome in humpback whales is an important advancement for health and disease monitoring of this species and of other large whales. IMPORTANCE The conservation and management of large whales rely in part upon health monitoring of individuals and populations, and methods generally necessitate invasive sampling. Here, we used a small, unmanned hexacopter drone to noninvasively fly above humpback whales from two populations, capture their exhaled breath (blow), and examine the associated microbiome. In the first extensive examination of the large-whale blow microbiome, we present surprising results about the discovery of a large core microbiome that was shared across individual whales from geographically separated populations in two ocean basins. We suggest that this core microbiome, in addition to other microbiome characteristics, could be a useful feature for health monitoring of large whales worldwide.}, author = {Apprill, Amy and Miller, Carolyn A and Moore, Michael J and Durban, John W and Fearnbach, Holly and Barrett-Lennard, Lance G}, doi = {10.1128/mSystems.00119-17}, issn = {2379-5077}, journal = {mSystems}, keywords = {SSU rRNA gene,bacteria,drone,humpback whale,microbiome}, month = {oct}, number = {5}, pages = {e00119--17}, pmid = {29034331}, publisher = {American Society for Microbiology Journals}, title = {{Extensive Core Microbiome in Drone-Captured Whale Blow Supports a Framework for Health Monitoring.}}, url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034331 http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5634792}, volume = {2}, year = {2017}}"

Resident killer whales live in stable matrilineal groups with repertoires of seven to 17 stereotyped call types. Some types are shared among matrilines, but their structure typically shows matriline-specific differences. Our objective was to analyse calls of nine killer whale matrilines in British Columbia to test whether call similarity primarily reflects social or genetic relationships. Recordings were made in 1985-1995 in the presence of focal matrilines that were either alone or with groups with non-overlapping repertoires. We used neural network discrimination performance to measure the similarity of call types produced by different matrilines and determined matriline association rates from 757 encounters with one or more focal matrilines. Relatedness was measured by comparing variation at 11 microsatellite loci for the oldest female in each group. Call similarity was positively correlated with association rates for two of the three call types analysed. Similarity of the N4 call type was also correlated with matriarch relatedness. No relationship between relatedness and association frequency was detected. These results show that call structure reflects relatedness and social affiliation, but not because related groups spend more time together. Instead, call structure appears to play a role in kin recognition and shapes the association behaviour of killer whale groups. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that increasing social complexity plays a role in the evolution of learned vocalisations in some mammalian species.}, author = {Deecke, Volker B. and Barrett-Lennard, Lance G. and Spong, Paul and Ford, John K.B.}, doi = {10.1007/s00114-010-0657-z}, isbn = {0028-1042}, issn = {00281042}, journal = {Naturwissenschaften}, keywords = {Gene-culture coevolution,Kin recognition,Social network,Vocal learning}, number = {5}, pages = {513--518}, pmid = {20213302}, title = {{The structure of stereotyped calls reflects kinship and social affiliation in resident killer whales (Orcinus orca)}}, volume = {97}, year = {2010}}"

To examine these issues, the development of calls of one male beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) calls was systematically studied at the Vancouver Aquarium throughout his first year of life and opportunistically through his second and third years. He vocalized within the first hour after birth, producing exclusively low energy, broadband pulse trains. Both the dominant frequency and the pulse repetition rate of the pulsed calls increased with age. He acquired rudimentary whistles at 2 wks of age. During the second month, whistle production increased substantially. Whistle dominant frequency tended to increase with age, and at least in his first year, whistles did not attain full stereotypy. The calf started using mixed call types consistently at 4mo. While some sounds tended to be more variable at later ages, his mixed calls progressively lost variability and increasingly resembled his mother's most predominant stereotyped mixed call type. By 20 mo, this call type was fully stereotyped. Six months after he was exposed to his father's sounds, he incorporated one of his father's call types into his repertoire.

Recent studies have used auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements to examine sound reception pathways. This study sought to determine how sound source placements, recording electrode arrangements, and ABR peak analyses affect interpretations of sound reception in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Click stimuli were delivered in air from a contact transducer (\"jawphone\"). Early ABR peaks (representing auditory nerve responses), and later peaks reflecting higher brainstem activity, were analyzed across jawphone and recording electrode positions. Auditory nerve responses were similar for jawphone placements from the ipsilateral posterior mandible to the tip of the rostrum. Later peaks, however, suggested a possible region of highest sensitivity midway between the posterior mandible and the rostrum tip. These findings are generally similar to previous data for porpoises. In contrast to auditory nerve responses that were largest when recorded near the ipsilateral meatus, later ABR peaks were largest when recorded with a contralateral (opposing) electrode. These results provide information on the processes underlying peaks of the ABR, and inform stimulus delivery and ABR recording parameters in odontocete sound reception studies.}, author = {Mulsow, Jason and Finneran, James J. and Houser, Dorian S. and Nordstrom, Chad A. and Barrett-Lennard, Lance G. and Burkard, Robert F.}, doi = {10.1121/1.5030921}, issn = {0001-4966}, journal = {The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America}, month = {apr}, number = {4}, pages = {2076--2084}, pmid = {29716282}, title = {{Click reception in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena): Effects of electrode and contact transducer location on the auditory brainstem response}}, url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29716282 http://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.5030921}, volume = {143}, year = {2018}}"

Empirical assessments of these impacts are difficult, however, because killer whales are sparsely distributed, highly mobile, and difficult to observe. We present a 4 yr time series of observa- tions of foraging and feeding behavior of 150 transient killer whales that aggregate annually during the northbound migration of gray whales past Unimak Island, Alaska. Most predatory attacks were on gray whale Eschrichtius robustus calves or yearlings and were quickly abandoned if calves were aggressively defended by their mothers. Attacks were conducted by groups of 3 to 4 killer whales, which attempted to drown their prey. Gray whales generally tried to move into shallow water along the shoreline when attacked; if they succeeded in reaching depths of 3 m or less, attacks were aban- doned. Kills occurred in waters from 15 to 75 m deep or were moved into such areas after death. After some hours of feeding, the carcasses were usually left, but were re-visited and fed on by killer whales over several days. Carcasses or pieces of prey that floated onshore were actively consumed by brown bears Ursus arctos, and carcasses on the bottom were fed on by sleeper sharks Somniosus pacificus, apparently increasing the local density of both species}, author = {Barrett-Lennard, Lance G. and Matkin, Craig O. and Durban, John W. and Saulitis, Eva L. and Ellifrit, David}, doi = {10.3354/meps08906}, isbn = {0171-8630}, issn = {01718630}, journal = {Marine Ecology Progress Series}, keywords = {Atching Preyc,Brown bear,Foraging strategy,Hale Gray,Killer whale,Predatory behavior,Scavenger,Sleeper shark}, pages = {229--241}, title = {{Predation on gray whales and prolonged feeding on submerged carcasses by transient killer whales at Unimak Island, Alaska}}, volume = {421}, year = {2011}}"

These records are the first of live Fin Whales in Queen Charlotte, Johnstone, Georgia and Juan De Fuca Straits and are also the only confirmed sightings between Vancouver Island and continental North America since 1930. Additionally, 12 dead Fin Whales all with evidence of ship strikes are reported in these waters between 1986 and 2017. Most (88{\\%}) sightings of live Fin Whales occurred between July and October and no individuals were documented dead or alive between January and April.

Previous genetic work assigned killer whales that occur seasonally in the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) and killer whales sampled off the Canary Islands (CI) to the same population. Here we present new analyses of photo-identification and individual genotypes to assess the level of contemporary gene flow and migration between study areas, and analyses of biomarkers to assess ecological differences. We identified 47 different individuals from 5 pods in the SoG and 16 individuals in the CI, with no matches found between the areas. Mitochondrial DNA control region haplotype was shared by all individuals sampled within each pod, suggesting that pods have a matrifocal social structure typical of this species, whilst the lack of shared mitogenome haplotypes between the CI and SoG individuals suggests that there was little or no female migration between groups. Kinship analysis detected no close kin between CI and SoG individuals, and low to zero contemporary gene flow. Isotopic values and organochlorine pollutant loads also suggest ecological differences between study areas. We further found that one individual from a pod within the SoG not seen in association with the other four pods and identified as belonging to a potential migrant lineage by genetic analyses, had intermediate isotopic values and contaminant between the two study areas. Overall our results suggest a complex pattern of social and genetic structuring correlated with ecological variation. Consequently at least CI and SoG should be considered as two different management units. Understanding this complexity appears to be an important consideration when monitoring and understanding the viability of these management units. Understand the viability will help the conservation of these threatened management units.}, author = {Esteban, Ruth and Verborgh, Philippe and Gauffier, Pauline and Gim{\\'{e}}nez, Joan and Mart{\\'{i}}n, Vidal and P{\\'{e}}rez-Gil, M{\\'{o}}nica and Tejedor, Marisa and Almunia, Javier and Jepson, Paul D. and Garc{\\'{i}}a-T{\\'{i}}scar, Susana and Barrett-Lennard, Lance G. and Guinet, Christophe and Foote, Andrew D. and {De Stephanis}, Renaud}, doi = {10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.043}, isbn = {1470160X}, issn = {1470160X}, journal = {Ecological Indicators}, keywords = {Conservation,Genetics,Pollutants,Social structure,Stable isotopes}, number = {October 2017}, pages = {291--300}, publisher = {Elsevier Ltd}, title = {{Using a multi-disciplinary approach to identify a critically endangered killer whale management unit}}, volume = {66}, year = {2016}}"

The investigation of categorical matching, an aspect of contextual vocal learning, is the first step toward determining how contextual learning plays a role in the use, comprehension, and categorization of sounds in the wild. To this end, we conducted a study at the Vancouver Aquarium to test the ability of a juvenile female beluga, Qila, to respond to playbacks of two types of in-air beluga calls with vocalizations that matched the category of call played (a scream, which is a vocalization type shaped over time with reinforcement and not part of this species'natural repertoire, and a pulse-train, a natural call category). We first tested Qila with random sequences of the same version of the two vocalizations with which she had been trained. Her overall success in matching all playback stimuli was above chance but not statistically so (66{\\%}). She had more difficulty matching screams (54{\\%} success) than pulse trains (80{\\%} success). We next played random sequences of six novel pulse-trains and seven novel screams, which Qila had not been trained with. She responded correctly to the set of novel stimuli of both call types in 64{\\%} of the trials, a success rate that did not differ statistically from chance. Again, she had more difficulty matching screams (55{\\%} success), relative to pulse trains (74{\\%} success). These results indicate that Qila successfully matched only pulse trains, the class that is part of this species' natural repertoire. Her poor performance on matching screams might be partly explained by a difficulty to perceive categorically a signal that lacks a function in the natural repertoire of belugas.}, archiveprefix = {arXiv}, arxivid = {arXiv:physics/0608246v3}, author = {Vergara, V. and Barrett-Lennard, L}, doi = {10.5811/westjem.2011.5.6700}, eprint = {0608246v3}, isbn = {9780980200454}, issn = {1936-900X}, journal = {International Journal of Comparative Psychology}, keywords = {belugas,categorical matching,categorization,contextual learning,vocal learning}, number = {1-20}, pages = {217--220}, pmid = {24696751}, primaryclass = {arXiv:physics}, title = {{Call Usage Learning by a Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) in a Categorical Matching Task Journal}}, url = {http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m8196s7}, volume = {30}, year = {2017}}"

We assayed variation across 262 individuals (204 putative harbour, 44 putative Dall's, 9 putative hybrids, and 5 unidentified porpoises) obtained primarily from strandings and initially identified morphologically. Our assays identified 198 pure (probability = 0.95) harbour porpoises, 37 pure Dall's porpoises, and 27 individuals of mixed ancestry, and we found that hybrids between the 2 species occurred over a larger geographic range than previously known. Analysis of 8 microsatellite loci was used to estimate a value of F-ST between the Strait of Georgia region and waters outside this area that was low and non-significant (FST = 0.0025, p  0.25). Cluster-based Bayesian analysis of population structure in harbour porpoises suggested a single genetic population across our sample area. Within the harbour porpoise, there were 50 mtDNA haplotypes that differed from each other by an average of 0.015 substitutions per nucleotide site. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated that there was no significant divergence between the waters within and the waters outside the Strait of Georgia region (Phi(ST) = -0.022, p  0.9). Our findings suggest that harbour porpoises inhabiting coastal waters of southern BC constitute a single genetic population, which should be reflected in management decisions.

The repertoires of resident killer whale pods in the northern Gulf of Alaska were updated from earlier studies, and the results used to determine the identity of pods that were recorded on remote hydrophones in Resurrection Bay, Alaska, in the fall, winter, and spring of 1999 to 2004. In total, seven pods of resident killer whales were identified acoustically, comprising four related pods from AB clan and three from AD clan. The frequencies of occurrence of the clans differed between the November to March recording period when AB clan occupied the area, and the April-May period when AD clan was predominant.

This has important implications for the cultural evolution of delphinid sounds: the greater the physical constraints, the greater the probability of random convergence. In this paper the authors examine the call structure of eight killer whale populations to identify structural constraints and to determine if they are consistent among all populations. Constraints were especially pronounced in two-voiced calls. In the calls of all eight populations, the lower component of two-voiced (biphonic) calls was typically centered below 4 kHz, while the upper component was typically above that value. The lower component of two-voiced calls had a narrower frequency range than single-voiced calls in all populations. This may be because some single-voiced calls are homologous to the lower component, while others are homologous to the higher component of two-voiced calls. Physical constraints on the call structure reduce the possible variation and increase the probability of random convergence, producing similar calls in different populations.}, author = {Filatova, Olga A. and Samarra, Filipa I.

Belugas are among the most vocal of cetaceans, but the function of their calls is poorly understood. In a previous study we hypothesized that a broad band pulsed call type labeled Type A, serves as a contact call between mothers and their calves. Here we examined context-specific use of call types recorded from a captive beluga social group at the Vancouver Aquarium, and found that the Type A call comprised 24{\\%} to 97{\\%} of the vocalizations during isolation, births, death of a calf, presence of external stressors, and re-union of animals after separation. In contrast it comprised 4.4{\\%} of the vocalizations produced during regular sessions. We grouped 2835 Type A calls into five variants, A1 to A5. A discriminant function analysis classified 87{\\%} of calls in the same groupings that we assigned them to by ear and visual examination of spectrograms. The variants do not represent individual signatures. One variant, A1, was used by three related individuals: an adult female, her male calf and his juvenile half-sister. Our previous research documented the gradual development of the A1 variant by the male calf, until at 20 months he was producing stereotyped renditions of his mother and sisters A1. We used our findings to generate testable predictions about the usage of these signals by wild belugas. We verified the existence of signals with the same distinctive features as the contact calls found in captivity in the repertoire of St. Lawrence Estuary herds, and documented their usage by two wild individuals from different populations. In the St. Lawrence, these were emitted by a female calling after a dead-calf. In Hudson Bay, by a temporarily restrained juvenile. We propose that these calls function in nature, as in captivity, to maintain group cohesion, and that the variants shared by related animals are used for mother-calf recognition.}, author = {Vergara, V. and Michaud, R. and Barrett-Lennard, L.G.}, isbn = {2168-3344}, issn = {15305678}, journal = {International Journal of Comparative Psychology}, pages = {278--309}, pmid = {17190236}, title = {{What can Captive Whales tell us About their Wild Counterparts?
