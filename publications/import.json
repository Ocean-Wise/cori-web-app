The experiment was performed in two phases: an initial training phase in which a basic two-line vs. one-line discrimination was established, and a testing phase which utilized this discrimination learning in determination of visual acuity. Visual discrimination learning throughout the training phase, was unexpectedly slow and apparently highly problem-specific, despite the use of a sequence of problems designed to facilitate initial learning. During the testing phase of the study, eight two-line vs. one-line test problems, differing only in two-line gap widths were presented in a random sequence 100 times each during 10 daily sessions, at a minimal viewing distance of 45 cm. A standard psychophysical difference threshold criterion was applied to the performance data, yielding an estimate of underwater visual acuity of approximately 6′ of arc, a value roughly comparable to that for the cat in air. The results of the study are interpreted as suggesting that dolphin vision is probably sufficiently well-developed for it to be a behaviorally significant modality, but that vision may well play only a relatively minor or specialised role in the guidance of normal underwater behavior.}, author = {Spong, Paul and White, Don}, doi = {10.1016/0014-4886(71)90245-7}, issn = {0014-4886}, journal = {Experimental Neurology}, month = {jun}, number = {3}, pages = {431--436}, publisher = {Academic Press}, title = {{Visual acuity and discrimination learning in the dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens)}}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014488671902457}, volume = {31}, year = {1971}}"

The northeast Pacific recently experienced a mass mortality of sea stars. In Howe Sound, British Columbia, the sunflower star italicPycnopodia helianthoides/italic —a previously abundant predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates—began to show signs of a wasting syndrome in early September 2013, and dense aggregations disappeared from many sites in a matter of weeks. Here, we assess changes in subtidal community composition by comparing the abundance of fish, invertebrates and macroalgae at 20 sites in Howe Sound before and after the 2013 sea star mortality to evaluate evidence for a trophic cascade. We observed changes in the abundance of several species after the sea star mortality, most notably a four-fold increase in the number of green sea urchins, italicStrongylocentrotus droebachiensis/italic , and a significant decline in kelp cover, which are together consistent with a trophic cascade. Qualitative data on the abundance of sunflower stars and green urchins from a citizen science database show that the patterns of echinoderm abundance detected at our study sites reflected wider local trends. The trophic cascade evident at the scale of Howe Sound was observed at half of the study sites. It remains unclear whether the urchin response was triggered directly, via a reduction in urchin mortality, or indirectly, via a shift in urchin distribution into areas previously occupied by the predatory sea stars. Understanding the ecological implications of sudden and extreme population declines may further elucidate the role of echinoderms in temperate seas, and provide insight into the resilience of marine ecosystems to biological disturbances. /p}, author = {Schultz, Jessica A. and Cloutier, Ryan N. and C{\\^{o}}t{\\'{e}}, Isabelle M.}, doi = {10.7717/peerj.1980}, journal = {PeerJ}, keywords = {sea star wasting}, mendeley-tags = {sea star wasting}, month = {apr}, pages = {e1980}, publisher = {PeerJ Inc.}, title = {{Evidence for a trophic cascade on rocky reefs following sea star mass mortality in British Columbia}}, url = {https://peerj.com/articles/1980}, year = {2016}}"

Consequently, the ratio between cDMR and cMRs was significantly higher in winter, sug- gestive of an increased thermal challenge and convective heat loss while diving. Increased cMRs fol- lowing the fast indicated that digestion began during foraging and was not deferred, implying that access to ingested energy was of higher priority than optimizing diving ability. cDMR was elevated throughout the recovery period, independent of season, resulting in a 12{\\%} increase in foraging cost in winter and a 3{\\%} increase in summer.

In contrast to single-species fisheries management, EBM aims to identify and resolve conflicting objectives for different species. Such a conflict may be emerging in the northeastern Pacific for southern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) and their primary prey, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Both species have at-risk conservation status and transboundary (Canada‚{\\\"{A}}{\\`{i}}US) ranges. We modeled individual killer whale prey requirements from feeding and growth records of captive killer whales and morphometric data from historic live-capture fishery and whaling records worldwide. The models, combined with caloric value of salmon, and demographic and diet data for wild killer whales, allow us to predict salmon quantities needed to maintain and recover this killer whale population, which numbered 87 individuals in 2009. Our analyses provide new information on cost of lactation and new parameter estimates for other killer whale populations globally. Prey requirements of southern resident killer whales are difficult to reconcile with fisheries and conservation objectives for Chinook salmon, because the number of fish required is large relative to annual returns and fishery catches. For instance, a U.S. recovery goal (2.3{\\%} annual population growth of killer whales over 28 years) implies a 75{\\%} increase in energetic requirements. Reducing salmon fisheries may serve as a temporary mitigation measure to allow time for management actions to improve salmon productivity to take effect. As ecosystem-based fishery management becomes more prevalent, trade-offs between conservation objectives for predators and prey will become increasingly necessary. Our approach offers scenarios to compare relative influence of various sources of uncertainty on the resulting consumption estimates to prioritise future research efforts, and a general approach for assessing the extent of conflict between conservation objectives for threatened or protected wildlife where the interaction between affected species can be quantified.}, author = {Williams, Rob and Krkosek, Martin and Ashe, Erin and Branch, Trevor A and Clark, Steve and Hammond, Philip S and Hoyt, Erich and Noren, Dawn P and Rosen, David A S and Winship, Arliss}, doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0026738}, journal = {PloS one}, number = {11}, pages = {e26738}, publisher = {Public Library of Science}, title = {{Competing conservation objectives for predators and prey: Estimating killer whale prey requirements for Chinook salmon}}, url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1371{\\%}2Fjournal.pone.0026738}, volume = {6}, year = {2011}}"

However, estimating the costs of foraging is difficult for breath-hold divers, such as Steller sea lions, that feed underwater. We developed models parameterized with data from free-diving captive Steller sea lions to estimate the costs incurred by wild animals while foraging. We measured diving metabolic rate of trained sea lions performing four types of dives to 10 and 40 m in the open ocean and estimated the separate costs of different dive components: surface time; bottom time; and transiting to and from depth. We found that the sea lions' diving metabolic rates were higher while transiting (20.5 ± 13.0 ml O2 min−1 kg−1) than while swimming at depth (13.5 ± 4.1 ml O2 min−1 kg−1), and both were higher than metabolism at the surface (9.2 ± 1.6 ml O2 min−1 kg−1). These values were incorporated into an energetic model that accurately predicted oxygen consumption for dives only (within 9.5{\\%}) and dive cycles (within 7.7{\\%}), although it consistently overestimated costs by 5.9{\\%} for dives and 21.8{\\%} for dive cycles. Differences in the costs of individual components of dives also explained differences in the efficiency of different dive strategies. Single dives were energetically less costly than bout dives; however, sea lions were more efficient at replenishing oxygen stores after bout dives and could therefore spend a greater portion of their time foraging than when undertaking single dives. The metabolic rates we measured for the different behavioural components of diving can be applied to time–depth recordings from wild Steller sea lions to estimate the energy expended while foraging. In turn, this can be used to understand how changes in prey availability affect energy balance and the health of individuals in declining populations.}, author = {Goundie, Elizabeth T and Rosen, David A S and Trites, Andrew W}, doi = {10.1093/conphys/cov052}, journal = {Conservation Physiology}, number = {1}, pages = {1--12}, title = {{Dive behaviour can predict metabolic expenditure in Steller sea lions}}, url = {http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/1/cov052.abstract}, volume = {3}, year = {2015}}"

We used down sampling to derive four recording rates from each accelerometer (Daily Diary: 32, 16, 8, 4 Hz; G6a+: 25, 20, 10, 5 Hz). For each of these sampling frequencies, we derived 20 combinations of two parameters (RMW, the window size used to calculate the running mean; and m, the minimum number of points smaller than a local maxima used to detect a peak) from the dynamic acceleration of x, z and x+z, to estimate stroke rate from the accelerometers. These estimates differed by up to ∼20{\\%} in comparison to the actual number of foreflipper strokes counted from videos. RMW and the choice of axis used to make the calculations (x, z or x+z) had little effect on the overall differences, though the variability was reduced when using x+z. The best m varied depending on the axis used and the sampling frequency; a larger m was needed for higher sampling frequencies.

Although some animals approached the limit of their protein‐sparing ability by the end of our fasting experiments, there was no sign of irreversible starvation biochemistry. Plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations decreased in all animals within the first week of fasting, reflecting a shift to a fasting‐adapted state; however, significant increases in plasma BUN concentration at the end of the nonbreeding season fasts suggest that subadult Steller sea lions were not able to maintain a protein‐sparing metabolism for a full 14 d during the nonbreeding season. In contrast, juveniles were able to enter protein sparing sooner during the nonbreeding season when they had slightly higher initial percent total body lipid stores than during the breeding season. Subadult and juvenile sea lions had low circulating ketone body concentrations compared with young sea lion pups, suggesting an age‐related difference in how body reserves are utilized during fasting or how the resulting metabolites are circulated and catabolized.

Five 1–2-year-old captive Steller sea lions were offered either herring (high energy)  or capelin (low energy) each day or every second day. When prey were available on a daily basis, the sea lions com-  pensated for differences in the energy content of herring and capelin by consuming sufficient quantities of each (8.3 vs.  14.0 kg{\\textperiodcentered}d–1, respectively) to maintain equivalent gross energy intakes. When herring was available only on alternate  days, the sea lions increased their consumption by 52{\\%} to 11.5 kg{\\textperiodcentered}d–1, which was not sufficient to maintain an average  gross intake equal to that maintained when herring was available every day.

The DLW method estimated that the fur seals expended 13.1 ± 16.5{\\%} more energy than indicat- ed by the more direct measures of oxygen consumption. Accelerometry failed to predict the average mass- specific rate of oxygen consumption (V ̇ O2DEE ) within the individual seasons over entire 5-day trials.

Estimates of covariance between surveys, in terms of their coverage of these clusters, indicated spatial population structure and seasonal movements from these near-shore waters, suggesting spatial and temporal variation in the predation pressure on coastal marine mammals.}, author = {Durban, J. and Ellifrit, D. and Dahlheim, M. and Waite, J. and Matkin, C. and Barrett-Lennard, L. and Ellis, G. and Pitman, R. and LeDuc, R. and Wade, P.}, doi = {10.1007/s00227-010-1432-6}, isbn = {0025-3162}, issn = {00253162}, journal = {Marine Biology}, number = {7}, pages = {1591--1604}, title = {{Photographic mark-recapture analysis of clustered mammal-eating killer whales around the Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska}}, volume = {157}, year = {2010}}"

The widespread occurrence of hybridization indicates that postmating barriers to interbreeding are incomplete within the order Cetacea, and therefore raises questions about how species integrity is maintained in the face of interspecific (and often intergeneric) gene flow. We examined hybridization across the order Cetacea (oceanic species included: N = 78; species with 44 chromosomes included: N = 52) to test for associations between the occurrence of hybridization and similarity across 13 ecological, morphological and behavioral traits in hybridizing vs. non-hybridizing species pairs. We found that species pairs that share a greater number of traits had a higher propensity to hybridize than pairs of species that did not. This trend was driven by behavioral and morphological traits such as vocalization frequency and body size. Together our findings suggest the importance of divergent selection on morphological and behavioral traits within sympatric species in constraining opportunities for hybridization and preventing the collapse of parental species.}, author = {Crossman, Carla A and Taylor, Eric B and Barrett-Lennard, Lance G}, doi = {10.1002/ece3.1913}, issn = {2045-7758}, journal = {Ecology and evolution}, keywords = {Cetaceans,hybridization,niche,principal component analysis,species traits}, month = {mar}, number = {5}, pages = {1293--303}, pmid = {27087919}, publisher = {Wiley-Blackwell}, title = {{Hybridization in the Cetacea: widespread occurrence and associated morphological, behavioral, and ecological factors.}}, url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27087919 http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4775523}, volume = {6}, year = {2016}}"

Here we report on the use of a small, unmanned hexacopter (APH-22; Aerial Imaging Solutions) as an alter-native method for collecting photographs to measure killer whales (Orcinus orca) at sea. We deployed and retrieved the hexacopter by hand during 60 flights (average duration 13.2 min, max 15.7 min) from the upper deck of an 8.2 m boat, utilizing the aircraft's vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability. The hexacopter was quiet and stable in flight, and therefore could be flown at relatively low altitudes without disturbing whales. The payload was a Micro Four-Thirds system camera that was used to obtain 18920 still images from an altitude of 35–40 m above the whales. Tests indicated a ground-resolved distance of 1.4 cm across the full extent of a flat and undistorted field of view, and an onboard pressure altimeter enabled measurements in pixels to be scaled to true size with an average accuracy of 5 cm. As a result, the images were sharp enough to differentiate individual whales using natural markings (77 whales in total) and preliminary estimates resolved differences in whale lengths ranging from 2.6 to 5.8 m. This first application at sea demonstrated the APH-22 hexacopter to be a safe and cost-effective platform for collecting photogrammetry images to fill key scientific data gaps about whales, and we anticipate this utility will extend to studies of other wildlife species.}, author = {Durban, J W and Fearnbach, H and Perryman, W L and Leroi, D J}, doi = {dx.doi.org/10.1139/juvs-2015-0020}, isbn = {209.129.115.6}, issn = {2291-3467}, journal = {Journal of Unmanned Vehicle Systems}, keywords = {hexacopter,uas,whales,wildlife vtol}, number = {June}, pages = {1--5}, pmid = {776}, title = {{Photogrammetry of killer whales using a small hexacopter launched at sea}}, volume = {3}, year = {2015}}"

In coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific, 2 such lineages have been well described: the so-called ‘residents' prey on teleost fish, especially salmonids and the other (‘transients') on marine mammals. A third lineage in this region (‘offshores') appears from chemical tracers to be ecologically distinct from residents and transients, but its diet is very poorly known. Here we describe 2 encounters with offshore killer whales during which multiple predation events involving sharks were observed. Using DNA analysis of tissue samples collected from these predation events, we identified the prey species as Pacific sleeper shark Somniosus pacificus and determined that a minimum of 16 individuals were consumed over the 2 encounters. This represents the first confirmed prey species of offshore killer whales based on field observations of foraging and the first record of any Somniosus species in the prey of Orcinus. We also show quantitatively that api- cal tooth wear is far greater in offshores than in resident and transient killer whales, and propose that such wear is at least in part due to abrasion from dermal denticles embedded in shark skin. Further studies are needed to determine whether offshore killer whales are as specialised ecologically as resident and transient killer whales, and whether sharks play a dominant role in their diet.}, author = {Ford, John K.B. and Ellis, Graeme M. and Matkin, Craig O. and Wetklo, Michael H. and Barrett-Lennard, Lance G. and Withler, Ruth E.}, doi = {10.3354/ab00307}, isbn = {1864-7790}, issn = {18647782}, journal = {Aquatic Biology}, keywords = {Ecological specialisation,Elasmobranch predation,Foraging strategy,Orcinus orca}, number = {3}, pages = {213--224}, title = {{Shark predation and tooth wear in a population of northeastern pacific killer whales}}, volume = {11}, year = {2011}}"

In the North Pacific, two sympatric populations (“resident” and “transient”) specialize on different prey (fish and marine mammals) and retain reproductive isolation. In the eastern North Atlantic, whales from the same populations have been observed feeding on both fish and marine mammals. Fish-eating North Pacific “residents” are more genetically related to eastern North Atlantic killer whales than to sympatric mammal-eating “transients.” In this paper, a comparison of frequency variables in killer whale calls recorded from four North Pacific resident, two North Pacific transient, and two eastern North Atlantic populations is reported to assess which factors drive the large-scale changes in call structure. Both low-frequency and high-frequency components of North Pacific transient killer whale calls have significantly lower frequencies than those of the North Pacific resident and North Atlantic populations. The difference in frequencies could be related to ecological specialization or to the phylogenetic history of these populations. North Pacific transient killer whales may have genetically inherited predisposition toward lower frequencies that may shape their learned repertoires.V}, author = {Filatova, Olga A. and Miller, Patrick J.
