abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), are ubiquitous environmental contaminants of which significant concentrations are reported in upper trophic level animals. In 1998, we collected blubber biopsy samples (n=11) from killer whales (Orcinus orca) inhabiting the coastal waters around Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago, southern Indian Ocean, for contaminant analyses. Despite inhabiting an isolated region far removed from industrial activities, these killer whales can presently be considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the southern hemisphere, with concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 20.5mg/kg lipid weight (lw). PCDD levels ranged from below the detection limit (5ng/kg) to 77.1ng/kglw and PCDF levels from below the detection limit (7ng/kg) to 36.1ng/kglw. Over 70{\%} of our study animals had PCB concentrations which exceeded a 1.3mg/kg PCB threshold established for endocrine disruption and immunotoxicity in free-ranging harbour seals, suggesting that organic contaminants cannot be ruled out as an additional threat to this declining population.},

In 1998, we collected blubber biopsy samples (n=11) from killer whales (Orcinus orca) inhabiting the coastal waters around Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago, southern Indian Ocean, for contaminant analyses. Despite inhabiting an isolated region far removed from industrial activities, these killer whales can presently be considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the southern hemisphere, with concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 20.5mg/kg lipid weight (lw). PCDD levels ranged from below the detection limit (5ng/kg) to 77.1ng/kglw and PCDF levels from below the detection limit (7ng/kg) to 36.1ng/kglw. Over 70{\%} of our study animals had PCB concentrations which exceeded a 1.3mg/kg PCB threshold established for endocrine disruption and immunotoxicity in free-ranging harbour seals, suggesting that organic contaminants cannot be ruled out as an additional threat to this declining population.},

Based on a combination of gross pathology, histopathology, bacterial isolation, and toxin testing, Clostridium difficile enterocolitis was diagnosed. Most pups were anorexic or inappetant and died acutely with few other premonitory signs. Due to ongoing clinical concerns and possible emergence of this pathogen at the facility, efforts to better characterize the disease and understand the epidemiology of C. difficile was initiated in 95 harbor seal pups presented for rehabilitation in a single stranding season.

Lamb et al.'s claim that UNEP/WHO (2013) does not provide a balanced perspective on endocrine disruption is based on incomplete and misleading quoting of the report through omission of qualifying statements and inaccurate description of study objectives, results and conclusions. Lamb et al. define extremely narrow standards for synthesizing evidence which are then used to dismiss the UNEP/WHO 2013 report as flawed. We show that Lamb et al. misuse conceptual frameworks for assessing causality, especially the Bradford–Hill criteria, by ignoring the fundamental problems that exist with inferring causality from empirical observations. We conclude that Lamb et al.'s attempt of deconstructing the UNEP/WHO (2013) report is not particularly erudite and that their critique is not intended to be convincing to the scientific community, but to confuse the scientific data. Consequently, it promotes misinterpretation of the UNEP/WHO (2013) report by non-specialists, bureaucrats, politicians and other decision makers not intimately familiar with the topic of endocrine disruption and therefore susceptible to false generalizations of bias and subjectivity.},

abstract = {Breath-hold divers should adjust their dive behaviors to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of foraging on prey patches of different densities at different depths. However, few studies have quantified how animals respond to changes in prey availability (depth and density), and how this affects their foraging efficiency. We tested the effects of changes in prey availability on the foraging behavior and efficiency of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) by measuring diving metabolic rate, dive durations, and food intake of 4 trained sea lions diving in the open ocean on controlled prey patches of different densities at different depths. Sea lions completed bouts of 5 consecutive dives on high- or low-density prey patches at two depths (10m and 40m). We found that the rate of energy expenditure did not change under any of the imposed foraging conditions (mean±SD: 0.22±0.02kJmin−1kg−1), but that the proportion of time spent consuming prey increased with prey patch density due to changes in diving patterns. At both depths, sea lions spent a greater proportion of the dive bout foraging on prey patches with high prey density, which led to high rates of energy gain (4.3±0.96kJmin−1kg−1) and high foraging efficiency (cost:benefit was 1:20). In contrast, the sea lions spent a smaller proportion of their dive bout actively feeding on prey patches with low prey density, and consequently had a lower energetic gain (0.91±0.29kJmin−1kg−1) and foraging efficiency (1:4). The 5-fold differences in foraging efficiency between the two types of prey patches were greater than the 3-fold differences that we expected based on differences in food availability. Our results suggest that sea lions faced with reduced prey availability forage less efficiently and therefore would have greater difficulty obtaining their daily energy requirements.},

abstract = {This review summarizes our current state of knowledge regarding the potential biological effects of mercury (Hg) exposure on fish and wildlife in the Canadian Arctic. Although Hg in most freshwater fish from northern Canada was not sufficiently elevated to be of concern, a few lakes in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut contained fish of certain species (e.g. northern pike, Arctic char) whose muscle Hg concentrations exceeded an estimated threshold range (0.5–1.0$\mu$gg-1 wet weight) within which adverse biological effects begin to occur. Marine fish species generally had substantially lower Hg concentrations than freshwater fish; but the Greenland shark, a long-lived predatory species, had mean muscle Hg concentrations exceeding the threshold range for possible effects on health or reproduction. An examination of recent egg Hg concentrations for marine birds from the Canadian Arctic indicated that mean Hg concentration in ivory gulls from Seymour Island fell within the threshold range associated with adverse effects on reproduction in birds. Mercury concentrations in brain tissue of beluga whales and polar bears were generally lower than levels associated with neurotoxicity in mammals, but were sometimes high enough to cause subtle neurochemical changes that can precede overt neurotoxicity. Harbour seals from western Hudson Bay had elevated mean liver Hg concentrations along with comparatively high muscle Hg concentrations indicating potential health effects from methylmercury (MeHg) exposure on this subpopulation. Because current information is generally insufficient to determine with confidence whether Hg exposure is impacting the health of specific fish or wildlife populations in the Canadian Arctic, biological effects studies should comprise a major focus of future Hg research in the Canadian Arctic. Additionally, studies on cellular interactions between Hg and selenium (Se) are required to better account for potential protective effects of Se on Hg toxicity, especially in large predatory Arctic fish, birds, and mammals.},

The offshore killer whales were shown to consume prey species that were distinctly different from those of sympatric resident and transient killer whales. In addition, it was confirmed that the offshores forage as far south as California. Thus, these results provide evidence that the offshores belong to a third killer whale ecotype. Resident killer whale populations showed a gradient in stable isotope profiles from west (central Aleutians) to east (Gulf of Alaska) that, in part, can be attributed to a shift from off-shelf to continental shelf-based prey. Finally, stable isotope ratio results, supported by field observations, showed that the diet in spring and summer of eastern Aleutian Island transient killer whales is apparently not composed exclusively of Steller sea lions.},

abstract = {The cost of vocal behaviour is usually expressed in energetic terms; however, many animals may pay additional costs when predators or potential prey eavesdrop on their vocal communication. The northeastern Pacific is home to two distinct ecotypes of killer whales, Orcinus orca, called residents and transients. Resident killer whales feed on fish, a prey with poor hearing abilities, whereas transient killer whales hunt marine mammals, which have sensitive underwater hearing within the frequency range of killer whale vocal communication. In this study, we investigated how the superior hearing ability of mammalian prey has shaped the vocal behaviour of the transient killer whale ecotype. We recorded pulsed calls and the associated behavioural context of groups of transient and resident killer whales in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. Transient killer whales produced pulsed calls significantly less frequently than residents. Transient killer whales only showed significant amounts of vocal behaviour after a marine mammal kill or when the whales were displaying surface-active behaviour. Vocal activity of transients increased after a successful attack on a marine mammal. Since marine mammals are able to detect killer whale pulsed calls and respond with antipredator behaviour, the reduced vocal activity of transients is probably due to a greater cost for calling in this ecotype resulting from eavesdropping by potential prey. The increase in vocal behaviour after a successful attack may represent food calling (informing other animals in the area about the presence of food), but is more likely to reflect an increase in social interactions during feeding and/or the fact that the cost for vocal behaviour is comparatively low after a successful attack.},

abstract = {Variation in vocal signals among populations and social groups of animals provides opportunities for the study of the mechanisms of behavioural change and their importance in generating and maintaining behavioural variation. We analysed two call types made by two matrilineal social groups of resident killer whales, Orcinus orca, over 12–13 years. We used a neural network-based index of acoustic similarity to identify mechanisms of call differentiation. A test for structural modification of the calls detected significant changes in one call type in both groups, but not in the other. For the modified call type, the rate of divergence between the two groups was significantly lower than the rate of modification within either group showing that calls were modified in a similar fashion in the two groups. An analysis of structural parameters detected no strong directionality in the change. The pattern of call modification could have been caused by maturational changes to the calls or, if killer whale dialects are learned behavioural traits, cultural drift in the structure of the calls together with horizontal transmission of modifications between the two groups. Such vocal matching between members of different matrilines would suggest that vocal learning is not limited to vertical transmission from mother to offspring, which has important implications for models of gene–culture coevolution.},

abstract = {Cultural lineages are based on learned social traditions that are stable for several generations. When cultural lineages also reflect common ancestry and/or are shared by individuals that live together they are called clans. The existence of clans among killer whales has been previously proposed but has not been confirmed. Here, we show that clans exist among resident type killer whales, Orcinus orca, in southern Alaska. Resident killer whales live in stable matrilines from which emigration of either sex has not been observed. Matrilines that associate regularly (≥50{\%} observation time) are called pods. Pods are believed to consist of closely related matrilines and share a unique repertoire of discrete call types. Pods that share parts of their repertoire form what Ford (1991, Canadian Journal of Zoology,69, 1454–1483) called an acoustic clan. Here, we identified discrete call types of seven pods from southern Alaska, using a method based on human discrimination of distinct aural and visual (spectrogram) differences. Mitochondrial DNA of members of each pod was also analysed. The repertoires of the seven pods were compared and two acoustically distinct groups of pods were identified. Each group was monomorphic for a different mitochondrial D-loop haplotype. Nevertheless, pods from different clans associated frequently. It thus appears that the acoustic similarities within groups, which we presume to be cultural, reflect common ancestry, and that these groups therefore meet the above definition of clans. We also argue that a combination of cultural drift and selection are the main mechanisms for the maintenance of clans. Copyright 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Blubber biopsy samples were obtained for contaminant analysis from two discrete populations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) which frequent the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Detailed life history information for the fish-eating `resident' population, comprising two distinct communities, and the marine mammal-eating `transient' killer whale population, provided an invaluable reference for the interpretation of contaminant concentrations. Total PCB concentrations (sum of 136 congeners detected) were surprisingly high in all three communities, but transient killer whales were particularly contaminated. PCB concentrations increased with age in males, but were greatly reduced in reproductively active females. The absence of age, sex and inter-community differences in concentrations of polychlorinated- dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and- dibenzofurans (PCDFs) may have partly reflected low dietary levels, but more importantly, metabolic removal of dioxin-like compounds in killer whales. While information on toxic thresholds does not exist for PCBs in cetaceans, total 2,3,7,8-TCDD Toxic Equivalents (TEQ) in most killer whales sampled easily surpassed adverse effects levels established for harbour seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging killer whales in this region are at risk for toxic effects. The southern resident and transient killer whales of British Columbia can now be considered among the most contaminated cetaceans in the world.},

Here we present such an analysis, based on field observations of predation and on the stomach contents of stranded killer whales collected over a 20-year period. In total, 22 species of fish and 1 species of squid were documented in the diet of resident-type killer whales; 12 of these are previously unrecorded as prey of O. orca.

abstract = {Despite well-documented experimental evidence of echolocation in toothed whales, virtually nothing is known about the use and functional significance of cetacean sonar in the wild. Here, the patterns of echolocation sounds produced by killer whales,Orcinus orca, off British Columbia and Alaska are described. Two sympatric populations with divergent food habits differed markedly in sonar sound production. Individuals belonging to the fish-eating ‘resident' population produced trains of characteristic sonar clicks, on average, 4{\%} of the time, 27 times more often than marine mammal-eating ‘transient' killer whales. The click trains of residents averaged 7s, more than twice as long as the trains of transients. Click repetition rates within resident's trains were constant or changed gradually; within transient's trains they often fluctuated abruptly. Transients produced isolated single or paired clicks at an average rate of 12/h, four times as often as residents. In general, the isolated clicks and infrequent, short and irregular trains of transients were less conspicuous against background noise than the sonar of residents. This difference in acoustic crypticity may reflect a flexible response to the probability of alerting prey, because marine mammals have more acute hearing than fish in the frequency range of sonar clicks. In both populations, echolocation use per individual decreased with increasing group size, suggesting the sharing of information between group members. No relationships were found between echolocation activity and water clarity for whales of either population. Transient whales often travelled or foraged without discernibly echolocating, suggesting that passive listening provides cues for prey detection and orientation.},

abstract = {Underwater vocalizations were recorded during repeated encounters with 16 pods, or stable kin groups, of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia. Pods were identified from unique natural markings on individuals. Vocal exchanges within pods were dominated by repetitious, discrete calls. Pods each produced 7–17 (mean 10.7) types of discrete calls. Individuals appear to acquire their pod's call repertoire by learning, and repertoires can persist with little change for over 25 years. Call repertoires differed significantly among pods in the resident population. The 16 pods formed four distinct acoustic associations, or clans, each having a unique repertoire of discrete calls, or vocal tradition. Pods within a clan shared several call types, but no sharing took place among clans. Shared calls often contained structural variations specific to each pod or group of pods in the clan. These variants and other differences in acoustic behaviour formed a system of related pod-specific d...},

The opposite was true for clutches of five, six, and eight eggs and when all clutches of four to eight eggs were pooled. Egg weight increased linearly with laying sequence for clutches of four, five, and eight eggs, and for clutches of four to eight eggs combined. Egg weight also varied with clutch size: large clutches contained heavier eggs throughout the clutch than did small clutches. Egg weight was not correlated significantly with the amount of food eaten around the time of egg laying. Furthermore, food consumption did not increase linearly through the laying sequence as did egg weight. These patterns suggest that complex investment allocation decisions underlie egg weight variation in the Bengalese finch.},

abstract = {Adult coho salmon and subadult rainbow trout were used in experiments with the anesthetic ketamine hydrochloride. The drug (30 mg/kg) was injected into the dorsal aorta through an indwelling cannula. Intravascular administration of ketamine caused an immediate cessation of ventilation in both species for 10 s to 300 s and a loss of balance. Ventilation rate recovered to pre-anesthesia values within 1–2 h and arterial oxygen values were at pre-anesthesia levels by 3–24 h. Anesthesia caused a significant acidosis in both species. The blood pH and plasma CO2 values had returned to pre-anesthesia levels by 4–24 h and 0.5-2 h, respectively. For adult salmon, five of seven animals were unresponsive to tail grabbing at 4 h while with juvenile trout, three of five fish were fully responsive to touch at 1 to 2 h. This difference in duration of anesthesia was likely size-related. The applications of this injectable anesthetic for commercial fish use, mainly in the transport of animals, are suggested, but its use with food fish has not been assessed.},

Red blood cell pHi was not preferentially regulated, and there was no evidence of RBC swelling or nucleoside triphosphate adjustment. Although there were no changes in arterial O2 levels during hypercapnia, ventilation immediately increased 2.7-fold through large changes in stroke volume and small changes in frequency, and declined only slightly through 24–48 h. PaCO2 equilibrated rapidly with PICO2, driving down arterial pHa, which was 65{\%} corrected through HCO3− accumulation by 24 h. In contrast, the extradural fluid outside the brain equilibrated only very slowly, and was clearly not involved in the ventilatory stimulation.

Skate were sampled for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acid-base status, intracellular pH of the brain (14C-DMO method), and pHi in other tissues throughout 24 h of exposure to PiCO2 = 7.5 Torr. CSF PCO2 rapidly equilibrated with the elevated PaCO2. Despite the much lower non-HCO3−1 buffer capacity in the CSF, CSF pH was not depressed to the same extent as blood pHa. CSF pH was also regulated more rapidly, returning to control levels by 8–10 h, whereas pHa remained significantly depressed at 24 h. Similarly, the pHis of the weakly buffered brain and heart ventricle were initially compensated more rapidly than those of more strongly buffered white muscle and red blood cells. However, brain pHi adjustment slowed markedly after 4 h and stabilized at only 70{\%} compensation by 20–24 h, suggesting that brain intracellular acidosis may play a role in the long-term increase in ventilation. CSF and brain were the only compartments which did not exhibit an apparent compounding metabolic acidosis during the initial stages of hypercapnic exposure. While these results illustrate the primacy of central acid-base regulation, they do not support a role for CSF pH in the long-term elevation of ventilation in response to hypercapnia. Depressions in pHa and brain phi appear the two mosly likely candidates for proximate stimuli.},

The threshold oxygen tension of the perfusate was between 25 and 46 Torr (3.33–6.13 kPa) for maintaining resting and maximum cardiac ouput, but was between 46 and 67 Torr (6.13 – 8.93 kPa) for maintaining maximum power output. Increasing the pacing frequency from 30 to 58 beats/min did not produce a proportionate increase in the maximum cardiac output because maximum stroke volume was reduced significantly.

The whales produced three types of sounds that were assumed to be social signals: discrete calls, variable calls, and aberrant calls. Discrete calls dominated vocalization in most contexts. An increase in production of variable and aberrant calls was observed during socializing and beach-rubbing activities. Each resident pod had a group-specific repertoire of 7–17 discrete call types (mean = 10.7) that was consistent over a number of years.

abstract = {ABSTRACT:  Streptococcus phocae is a pathogen of marine mammals, although its pathogenicity remains poorly understood. Recovery of this bacterium from asymptomatic carriers suggests that it is an opportunistic pathogen. We investigated the role of S. phocae in naturally occurring disease and its significance as a pathogen based on postmortem investigations. Between 2007 and 2012, 1,696 whole carcasses, tissue samples, or both were submitted from the northeastern Pacific and Arctic Canada for diagnostic testing. Streptococcus phocae was cultured from phocids (n=66), otariids (n=12), harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena; n=5), and sea otters (Enhydra lutris; n=2). Pathologic manifestations of S. phocae–associated disease included localized, as well as systemic, inflammatory lesions with common findings of suppurative bronchopneumonia (n=17) and bacteremia (n=27). Lung lesions were frequently culture-positive for S. phocae, suggesting commensal colonization of the oropharynx with subsequent opportunistic infe...},

abstract = {Abstract Cryptococcosis has been reported in marine mammals in the northeastern Pacific with increasing frequency in the last 15 yr. Although a variety of cetaceans have been diagnosed with cryptococcosis, Cryptococcus gattii has not been reported in pinnipeds. We document C. gattii VGIIa in a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) pup and in an unrelated adult. Both animals were presented to Vancouver Aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre (VAMMRC) with generalized weakness, dehydration, respiratory compromise, minimally responsive mentation, and suboptimal body condition. Necropsy and histopathology findings were consistent in both animals and featured generalized lymphadenopathy, bronchopneumonia, and meningoencephalitis with intralesional yeast and fungemia. Cryptococcal serum antigen titers were ≥1,024 in both animals. Fungal culture of lung and lymph nodes confirmed C. gattii. Exposure was likely via inhalation prior to presentation to VAMMRC, and C. gattii infection was the proximate cause of death. This rep...},

This report represents the first known multidisciplinary team approach to emergency laparotomy in a compromised, 22-yr-old, female Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). The inciting clinical signs and ancillary diagnostics were consistent with a mechanical ileus. Although no torsion or obstruction was apparent during surgery, severe enteritis and peritonitis were noted. Postoperatively, the animal was maintained on aggressive medical management with continuous supportive care until succumbing 3 days later with clinical pathology indicative of terminal sepsis and profound inflammation. Postmortem findings included generalized vascular stasis and segmental intestinal volvulus with infarction. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the most-complex surgical and anesthetic procedures performed in a cetacean. Though the outcome was unsuccessful, this case represents...},

Bacteria, including Vibrio spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp., have been isolated during specific mortality events. Aquarium collection sea urchins are also subject to bacterial infections and could benefit from antimicrobial treatment, but pharmacokinetic studies have been lacking for this invertebrate group until recently. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin and its active metabolite ciprofloxacin in the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) after intracoelomic injection and medicated bath immersion administration. The utility of a population pharmacokinetic method using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NLME) was also evaluated. Thirty sea urchins were assigned to either the injection or immersion group. Twelve study animals and three untreated controls were utilized for each administration method: enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg intracoelomic injection or a 6-hr enrof...},

abstract = {Internal pressures change throughout a cetacean's body during swimming or diving, and uneven pressures between the thoracic and abdominal compartments can affect the cardiovascular system. Pressure differentials could arise from ventral compression on each fluke downstroke or by a faster equilibration of the abdominal compartment with changing ambient ocean pressures compared with the thoracic compartment. If significant pressure differentials do develop, we would expect the morphology of the diaphragm to adapt to its in vivo loading. Here, we tested the hypothesis that significant pressure differentials develop between the thoracic and abdominal cavities in diving cetaceans by examining diaphragms from several cetacean and pinniped species. We found that: (1) regions of cetacean diaphragms possess subserosal collagen fibres that would stabilize the diaphragm against craniocaudal stretch; (2) subserosal collagen covers 5-60{\%} of the thoracic diaphragm surface, and area correlates strongly with published values for swimming speed of each cetacean species (P{\textless}0.001); and (3) pinnipeds, which do not locomote by vertical fluking, do not possess this subserosal collagen. These results strongly suggest that this collagen is associated with loads experienced during a dive, and they support the hypothesis that diving cetaceans experience periods during which abdominal pressures significantly exceed thoracic pressures. Our results are consistent with the generation of pressure differentials by fluking and by different compartmental equilibration rates. Pressure differentials during diving would affect venous and arterial perfusion and alter transmural pressures in abdominal arteries.},

abstract = {Pinnipeds, including many endangered and declining species, are inaccessible and difficult to monitor for extended periods using externally attached telemetry devices that are shed during the annual molt. Archival satellite transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally into four rehabilitated California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and 15 wild juvenile Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) to determine the viability of this surgical technique for the deployment of long-term telemetry devices in otariids. The life history transmitters record information throughout the life of the host and transmit data to orbiting satellites after extrusion following death of the host. Surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia and single (n = 4) or dual (n = 15) transmitters were inserted into the ventrocaudal abdominal cavity via an 8.5 to 12 cm incision along the ventral midline between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis or preputial opening. Surgeries lasted 90 minutes (SD = 8) for the 19 sea lions. All animals recovered well and were released into the wild after extended monitoring periods from 27 to 69 days at two captive animal facilities. Minimum post-implant survival was determined via post-release tracking using externally attached satellite transmitters or via opportunistic re-sighting for mean durations of 73.7 days (SE = 9.0, Z. californianus) and 223.6 days (SE = 71.5, E. jubatus). The low morbidity and zero mortality encountered during captive observation and post-release tracking periods confirm the viability of this surgical technique for the implantation of long-term telemetry devices in otariids.},

abstract = {The digestive efficiency of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) feeding on their principal prey, the ringed seal (Phoca hispida) is high. Apparent digestibilities of 83.7 ± 10.3{\%} for dietary protein, 97.3 ± 2.1{\%} for dietary fat, and an assimilation of dietary energy of 91.7 ± 5.8{\%} were found for the five diets. Presence of hair and bone in the diet significantly reduced the apparent digestibility of protein N. Gastrointestinal transit times were affected principally by the fat (energy) content of the diet and varied between 12.3 ± 1.9 to 38.0 ± 8.0 h. The results explain the apparent preference for seal blubber by polar bears in the arctic as well as demonstrate that any seal {\textgreater} 1 month of age would satisfy the bear's daily energy requirements. The limiting factors in energy intake at a given feeding are the stomach capacity of the bear and the relative proportion of blubber and meat ingested.},

The affinity of the triploid salmon blood for oxygen (P50) was the same as that of diploids. However, the hemoglobinoxygen loading ratio (Hufner's constant) for the triploid salmon was only 77{\%} of the diploid values. The reduced hemoglobin-oxygen loading ratio, in concert with lower blood hemoglobin concentration, resulted in the triploid salmon having a maximum blood oxygen content which was only 68{\%} of that of the diploids. Although a reduced ability to transport oxygen may not be deleterious to resting fish, it may hinder the triploids' ability to obtain oxygen under conditions that require exertion.},

Hemoglobin concentrations were low in all three species, ranging from 4.4 to 5.4 g/100 ml. Mean erythrocyte volumes were relatively large, and ranged from 277 micron3 in M. berglax to 672 micron3 in A. rostrata. Blood oxygen dissociation curves were hyperbolic, with relatively low Hill constants (0.95-1.26). Mean P50 values ranged from 10 mmHg in M. berglax to 28 mmHg in L. esmarkii. It is concluded that the hematology and oxygen-binding characteristics of the blood of these three deep-sea fish reflects adaptations to low metabolic rates and low general activity habits.},

abstract = {Amazonian manatees (Trichechus inunguis), restricted to deep water areas in the larger lakes in the central Amazon during the dry season, do not have any obvious food sources until water levels rise between 1-2 m. Evidence from Lago Amana suggests almost seven months of fasting. Manatees may eat dead vegetative matter of both autochthonous and allochthonous origin, relying on hindgut fermentation to derive nutritive value from such material. It is suggested that the extremely low metabolic rate (36{\%} of standard) and the large quantity of blubber may represent critical adaptations in the survival of this species during prolonged dry seasons. It may be calculated that a fat manatee may survive up to 200 days before exhausting its lipid reserves.},

abstract = {The effects of temperature, red cell concentration, and shear rate on the viscosity of blood from the winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) were evaluated using a cone-plate viscometer. The viscosity of blood and plasma was shear rate dependent at all temperatures studied (−1 to 20 °C) with the highest values occurring at the lowest temperature and shear rate. At normal hematocrits (20{\%}), plasma appeared to account for at least 50{\%} of the total blood viscosity. The effects of hematocrit on viscosity were dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures (10–20 °C), increases in hematocrit resulted in a near-exponential increase in viscosity. At lower temperatures (5 °C) and shear rates (4.5 s−1) no significant increase in viscosity occurred between hematocrits of 11 and 43{\%}. The influence of temperature and shear rate on blood viscosity suggest that winter flounder may have to contend with a fivefold increase in blood viscosity when acclimating from summer to winter water temperatures.},

The confirmation of a primarily rod retina, high receptor: ganglion cell ratio and low refractive error under water were of note. A visual pigment based upon vitamin A1 and a difference spectrum of $\lambda$ max at 505 nm was in agreement with Dartnalls nomogram.

Frequency ranges of pulsed and pure tone vocalizations are found to be somewhat greater than previously observed. An earlier report that narwhals generate exclusively narrowband sounds is confirmed. Narwhal pulses appear to have a potential function as both orientation and communication signals. Pulse series having irregular repetition rates resemble the echolocation clicks of captive delphinids, and it is suggested that they serve a similar purpose. Pulse series having regular changes in repetition rate and distinct aural tones probably serve as social signals. The regular recurrence of a number of recognizably distinct pulsed tones suggests that the narwhal has 'signature' calls similar to several other odontocetes.},

The experiment was performed in two phases: an initial training phase in which a basic two-line vs. one-line discrimination was established, and a testing phase which utilized this discrimination learning in determination of visual acuity. Visual discrimination learning throughout the training phase, was unexpectedly slow and apparently highly problem-specific, despite the use of a sequence of problems designed to facilitate initial learning. During the testing phase of the study, eight two-line vs. one-line test problems, differing only in two-line gap widths were presented in a random sequence 100 times each during 10 daily sessions, at a minimal viewing distance of 45 cm. A standard psychophysical difference threshold criterion was applied to the performance data, yielding an estimate of underwater visual acuity of approximately 6′ of arc, a value roughly comparable to that for the cat in air. The results of the study are interpreted as suggesting that dolphin vision is probably sufficiently well-developed for it to be a behaviorally significant modality, but that vision may well play only a relatively minor or specialised role in the guidance of normal underwater behavior.},

Glycolysis, as indicated by lactic acid accumulation, clearly proceeded at temperatures down to and including −20 °C, and some evidence was obtained to indicate that it may proceed at a very low rate indeed (of the order of 0.5 $\mu$mole lactic acid formed/g of muscle/month, or less) at a temperature of −30 °C. Acid-labile and acid-soluble phosphorus decreased during storage at temperatures down to and including −20 °C in muscle frozen by either procedure, but only in the more slowly frozen muscle at −30 °C.

This represented 3.4{\%} ± 0.3{\%} of the gross energy intake for the grass and 5.4{\%} ± 0.8{\%} for the water hyacinth. There was no increase in metabolic rate after feeding indicating specific dynamic action (SDA). Given the hindgut fermentation and prolonged passage times in manatees, the SDA was most likely a component of the resting metabolic rate rather than a discrete event. Fasting the manatees for 2 wk caused a 17.5{\%} decrease in body weight and a 22.5{\%} decrease in metabolic rate but no decrease in the weight-specific metabolic rate. Observations during the fast indicate that manatees reduce their daily energy requirements by a reduction in activity.

abstract = {The protection of imperilled fish species is increasingly urgent given ongoing fisheries declines and the degradation of aquatic habitats. In Canada, threatened aquatic species were less likely than terrestrial species to be listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), the main legal instrument for bestowing protection, in the early years of the Act's implementation. In this paper, the existence of economic thresholds that might have hampered the protection of Canadian marine and freshwater fishes is examined. The analysis of the socio-economic data used to inform listing decisions about threatened fish taxa over the past decade reveals that the likelihood of being listed declines non-linearly with increasing estimated costs of protection but does not vary with proposed threat status. The estimated threshold cost (i.e., the point at which the likelihood of not being listed=0.5) was {\~{}}{\$}5,000,000 ({\~{}}{\$}1,400,000 to {\~{}}{\$}31,400,000, 95{\%} CI) per decade for freshwater species but only {\~{}}{\$}90,000 ({\$}{\~{}}50,000 to {\~{}}{\$}140,000, 95{\%} CI) per decade for marine fish taxa. In fact, no marine fish species with an anticipated cost of listing greater than zero was listed for protection. The presence of existing management legislation and qualitative statements about negative impacts of listing on exploitation generally led to denying protection to marine but not to freshwater species. These findings highlight both a large and inconsistent emphasis on costs of protection in SARA listing decisions, to the detriment of marine fish species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Echinoderm population collapses, driven by disease outbreaks and climatic events, may be important drivers of population dynamics, ecological shifts and biodiversity. The northeast Pacific recently experienced a mass mortality of sea stars. In Howe Sound, British Columbia, the sunflower star {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pycnopodia helianthoides{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} —a previously abundant predator of bottom-dwelling invertebrates—began to show signs of a wasting syndrome in early September 2013, and dense aggregations disappeared from many sites in a matter of weeks. Here, we assess changes in subtidal community composition by comparing the abundance of fish, invertebrates and macroalgae at 20 sites in Howe Sound before and after the 2013 sea star mortality to evaluate evidence for a trophic cascade. We observed changes in the abundance of several species after the sea star mortality, most notably a four-fold increase in the number of green sea urchins, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , and a significant decline in kelp cover, which are together consistent with a trophic cascade. Qualitative data on the abundance of sunflower stars and green urchins from a citizen science database show that the patterns of echinoderm abundance detected at our study sites reflected wider local trends. The trophic cascade evident at the scale of Howe Sound was observed at half of the study sites. It remains unclear whether the urchin response was triggered directly, via a reduction in urchin mortality, or indirectly, via a shift in urchin distribution into areas previously occupied by the predatory sea stars. Understanding the ecological implications of sudden and extreme population declines may further elucidate the role of echinoderms in temperate seas, and provide insight into the resilience of marine ecosystems to biological disturbances. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Eighty-one Californian sea lions (Zalophus californianus) with signs of domoic acid toxicity stranded along the coast of California in 1998 when there were blooms of the domoic acid-producing alga Pseudonitzschia australis off-shore. In 2000, a further 184 sea lions stranded with similar clinical signs, but the strandings occurred both during detectable algal blooms and after the blooms had subsided. The clinical signs in these 265 Californian sea lions included seizures, ataxia, head weaving, decreased responsiveness to stimuli and scratching behaviour. Affected animals had high haematocrits, and eosinophil counts, and high activities of serum creatine kinase. They were treated supportively by using fluid therapy, diazepam, lorazepam and phenobarbitone. Fifty-five of the 81 sea lions (68 per cent) affected in 1998 and 81 of the 184 (44 per cent) affected in 2000 died despite the treatment. Three of the 23 sea lions which survived in 1998 were tracked with satellite and radiotransmitters; they travelled as far south as San Miguel Island, California, and survived for at least three months. Eleven of the 129 animals which were released stranded within four months of being released.},

Surgical excision revealed the subcutaneous mass to be covered in haired skin with multiple glabrous areas and structures resembling a jaw with tooth buds, eyelids, and a tail. The mass deformed the host pup's skull. Histologic examination revealed a complete vertebra in the tail, teeth in the jaw, and areas resembling tongue and larynx. Class 1 MHC sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the mass and the host twin were identical. The mass was diagnosed as a fetus in fetu, a rare congenital anomaly in which 1 conjoined twin is completely enclosed in the body of the other twin. The host pup died, and no additional defects were found; however, blubber levels of persistent organic pollutants were high. The cause of the congenital anomaly in this pup is uncertain.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of food intake and its subsequent effect on growth are required to understand the interaction between an animal's physiology and its biotic environment. We determined how food intake and growth of six young northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus (L., 1758)) responded seasonally to changes in food availability. Animals were given unrestricted access to prey for 8 h{\textperiodcentered}day–1 on either consecutive days or on alternate days only. We found animals offered ad libitum food on consecutive days substantially increased their food intake over normal “training” levels. However, animals that fasted on alternate days were unable to compensate by further increasing their levels of consumption on subsequent feeding days. Absolute levels of food intake were highly consistent during winter and summer trials (2.7–2.9 kg{\textperiodcentered}day–1), but seasonal differences in body mass meant that fur seals consumed more food relative to their body mass in summer ({\~{}}27{\%}) than in winter ({\~{}}20{\%}). Despite significant increases in absolute food intake during both seasons, the fur seals did not appear to efficiently convert this additional energy into mass growth, particularly in the winter. These seasonal differences in con- version efficiencies and estimates of maximum intake rates can be used to generate physiologically realistic predictions about the effect of changes in food availability on an individual fur seal, as well as the consequences for an entire population.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in availability of prey resources can impede acquisition of sufficient energy for maintenance and growth. By investigating the hormonal mechanisms of the somatotropic axis that link nutrition, fat metabolism, and lean tissue accretion, we can assess the physiological impact of decreased nutrient intake on growth. Further, species that undergo seasonal periods of reduced intake as a part of their normal life history may have a differential seasonal response to nutrient restriction. This experiment evaluated the influence of season and age on the response of the somatotropic axis, including growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, and IGF- binding proteins (BP), to reduced nutrient intake and re-alimentation in Steller sea lions. Eight captive females (five juveniles, three sub-adults) were subject to 28-day periods of food restriction, controlled re-feeding, and ad libitum recovery in summer (long-day photoperiod) and winter (short-day photoperiod). Hormone concentrations were insensitive to type of fish fed (low fat pollock vs. high fat herring), but sensitive to energy intake. Body mass, fat, and IGF-I declined, whereas GH and IGFBP-2 increased during feed restriction. Reduced IGF-I and IGFBP with increased GH during controlled re-feeding suggest that animals did not reach positive energy balance until fed ad libitum. Increased IGF-I, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and reduced GH observed in summer reflected seasonal differences in energy partitioning. There was a strong season and age effect in the response to restriction and re-alimentation, indicating that older, larger animals are better able to cope with stress associated with energy deficit, regardless of season.},

abstract = {Animal‐borne instruments have become a standard tool for collecting important data from marine mammals. However, few studies have examined whether placement of these data loggers affects the behavior and energetics of individual animals, potentially leading to biasing data. We measured the effect of two types of relatively small data loggers ({\textless}1{\%} of animals' mass and front profile) on the swimming speeds and energy expenditure of four female northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) while swimming at depth. Swim speeds and rates of oxygen consumption were measured as the trained fur seals repeatedly swam an underwater circuit, with or without the tags. We found the placement of either tested tag significantly affected both the behavior and energetics of the fur seals in our study. Diving metabolic rate increased an average of 8.1{\%}–12.3{\%} (depending on tag type) and swim speed decreased an average of 3.0{\%}–6.0{\%} when wearing the tags. The combined changes in velocities and metabolic rates resulted in a 12.0{\%}–19.0{\%} increase in the total energy required by the fur seals to swim a set distance. The demonstrated effects of tags on behavior and energy expenditure may bias data sets from wild animals and potentially incur longer‐term impacts on the studied animals.},

abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction techniques were developed and applied to identify DNA from {\textgreater}40 species of prey contained in fecal (scat) soft-part matrix collected at terrestrial sites used by Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in British Columbia and the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Sixty percent more fish and cephalopod prey were identified by morphological analyses of hard parts compared with DNA analysis of soft parts (hard parts identified higher relative proportions of Ammodytes sp., Cottidae, and certain Gadidae). DNA identified 213 prey occurrences, of which 75 (35{\%}) were undetected by hard parts (mainly Salmonidae, Pleuronectidae, Elasmobranchii, and Cephalopoda), and thereby increased species occurrences by 22{\%} overall and species richness in 44{\%} of cases (when comparing 110 scats that amplified prey DNA). Prey composition was identical within only 20{\%} of scats. Overall, diet composition derived from both identification techniques combined did not differ significantly from hard-part identification alone, suggesting that past scat-based diet studies have not missed major dietary components. However, significant differences in relative diet contributions across scats (as identified using the two techniques separately) reflect passage rate differences between hard and soft digesta material and highlight certain hypothesized limitations in conventional morphological-based methods (e.g., differences in resistance to digestion, hard part regurgitation, partial and secondary prey consumption), as well as potential technical issues (e.g., resolution of primer efficiency and sensitivity and scat subsampling protocols). DNA analysis of salmon occurrence (from scat soft-part matrix and 238 archived salmon hard parts) provided species-level taxonomic resolution that could not be obtained by morphological identification and showed that Steller sea lions were primarily consuming pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Notably, DNA from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that likely originated from a distant fish farm was also detected in two scats from one site in the eastern Aleutian Islands. Overall, molecular techniques are valuable for identifying prey in the fecal remains of marine predators. Combining DNA and hard-part identification will effectively alleviate certain predicted biases and will ultimately enhance measures of diet richness, fisheries interactions (especially salmon-related ones), and the ecological role of pinnipeds and other marine predators, to the benefit of marine wildlife conservationists and fisheries managers.},

abstract = {Variation in concentrations of thyroid hormones shed in feces may help to identify physiological states of animals, but the efficacy of the technique needs to be validated for each species. We determined whether a known physiological alteration to thyroid hormone production was reflected in hormone concentrations in the feces of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). We quantified variation of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations in feces following two intramuscular injections of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH) at 24†h intervals in four captive female sea lions. We found fecal T3 concentrations increased 18-57{\%} over concentrations measured in the baseline sample collected closest to the time of the first TSH injection (p†=†0.03) and 1-75{\%} over the mean baseline concentration (p†=†0.12) for each animal of all samples collected prior to injections. Peak T3 concentrations were greater than the upper bound of the baseline 95{\%} confidence interval for three animals. The peak T3 response occurred 48†h post-injection in three animals and 71†h in the fourth. Post-injection T4 concentrations did not differ between the baseline sample collected closest to the time of the first TSH injection (p†=†0.29) or the mean baseline concentration (p†=†0.23) for each animal. These results indicate that induced physiological alterations to circulating thyroid hormone concentrations can be adequately detected through analyses of fecal T3 concentrations and that the technique may provide a means of non-invasively detecting metabolic changes in Steller sea lions.},

abstract = {Changes in metabolic rates were measured in 3 captive female Steller sea lions Eume- topias jubatus that experienced fasts during summer and winter. We measured metabolic rates (via O2 consumption) before (MRs, surface) and after (DMR, dive + surface interval) the sea lions dove to 10–50 m depths. Measurements were obtained prior to and immediately after 9 to 10 d fasts, and dur- ing a 14 d recovery period. The sea lions lost significantly more body mass (Mb) during the winter fast (10.6{\%}), compared with the summer (9.5{\%}). Mass-corrected dive metabolic rate (cDMR = DMR × Mb–0.714) was not affected by dive depth or duration, but increased significantly following the winter fasts (13.5 ± 8.1{\%}), but did not change during summer (–1.1 ± 3.2{\%}). However, mass-corrected surface metabolic rate (cMRs) decreased significantly after both the summer (–16.4 ± 4.7{\%}) and winter (–8.0 ± 9.0{\%}) fasts. Consequently, the ratio between cDMR and cMRs was significantly higher in winter, sug- gestive of an increased thermal challenge and convective heat loss while diving. Increased cMRs fol- lowing the fast indicated that digestion began during foraging and was not deferred, implying that access to ingested energy was of higher priority than optimizing diving ability. cDMR was elevated throughout the recovery period, independent of season, resulting in a 12{\%} increase in foraging cost in winter and a 3{\%} increase in summer. Our data suggest that Steller sea lions are more sensitive to changes in body condition due to food shortages in the winter compared with the summer.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of marine resources attempts to conserve interacting species. In contrast to single-species fisheries management, EBM aims to identify and resolve conflicting objectives for different species. Such a conflict may be emerging in the northeastern Pacific for southern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) and their primary prey, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Both species have at-risk conservation status and transboundary (Canada‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}US) ranges. We modeled individual killer whale prey requirements from feeding and growth records of captive killer whales and morphometric data from historic live-capture fishery and whaling records worldwide. The models, combined with caloric value of salmon, and demographic and diet data for wild killer whales, allow us to predict salmon quantities needed to maintain and recover this killer whale population, which numbered 87 individuals in 2009. Our analyses provide new information on cost of lactation and new parameter estimates for other killer whale populations globally. Prey requirements of southern resident killer whales are difficult to reconcile with fisheries and conservation objectives for Chinook salmon, because the number of fish required is large relative to annual returns and fishery catches. For instance, a U.S. recovery goal (2.3{\%} annual population growth of killer whales over 28 years) implies a 75{\%} increase in energetic requirements. Reducing salmon fisheries may serve as a temporary mitigation measure to allow time for management actions to improve salmon productivity to take effect. As ecosystem-based fishery management becomes more prevalent, trade-offs between conservation objectives for predators and prey will become increasingly necessary. Our approach offers scenarios to compare relative influence of various sources of uncertainty on the resulting consumption estimates to prioritise future research efforts, and a general approach for assessing the extent of conflict between conservation objectives for threatened or protected wildlife where the interaction between affected species can be quantified.},

abstract = {Quantification of costs associated with foraging contributes to understanding the energetic impact that changes in prey availability have on the energy balance of an animal and the fitness of populations. However, estimating the costs of foraging is difficult for breath-hold divers, such as Steller sea lions, that feed underwater. We developed models parameterized with data from free-diving captive Steller sea lions to estimate the costs incurred by wild animals while foraging. We measured diving metabolic rate of trained sea lions performing four types of dives to 10 and 40 m in the open ocean and estimated the separate costs of different dive components: surface time; bottom time; and transiting to and from depth. We found that the sea lions' diving metabolic rates were higher while transiting (20.5 ± 13.0 ml O2 min−1 kg−1) than while swimming at depth (13.5 ± 4.1 ml O2 min−1 kg−1), and both were higher than metabolism at the surface (9.2 ± 1.6 ml O2 min−1 kg−1). These values were incorporated into an energetic model that accurately predicted oxygen consumption for dives only (within 9.5{\%}) and dive cycles (within 7.7{\%}), although it consistently overestimated costs by 5.9{\%} for dives and 21.8{\%} for dive cycles. Differences in the costs of individual components of dives also explained differences in the efficiency of different dive strategies. Single dives were energetically less costly than bout dives; however, sea lions were more efficient at replenishing oxygen stores after bout dives and could therefore spend a greater portion of their time foraging than when undertaking single dives. The metabolic rates we measured for the different behavioural components of diving can be applied to time–depth recordings from wild Steller sea lions to estimate the energy expended while foraging. In turn, this can be used to understand how changes in prey availability affect energy balance and the health of individuals in declining populations.},

abstract = {Given that many marine mammals display seasonal energetic priorities, it is important to investigate whether the impact of unexpected food restriction differs during the year. Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) fed restricted diets for up to 9 days during spring, summer, fall, and winter lost an average of 10{\%} of their initial body mass. We tracked changes in the levels of three hormones (cortisol, total thyroxine—TT4, total triiodothyronine—TT3) and one blood metabolite (blood urea nitrogen—BUN) following a food restriction in relation to season, body mass, body composition, and metabolism. Degree of changes in cortisol, TT3, and BUN after food restriction was significantly affected by season. The greatest changes in cortisol (+231{\%}), BUN (+11.4{\%}), TT4 (−23.3{\%}), and TT3 (−35.6{\%}) occurred in the winter (November/December) when rates of body mass loss were also greatest. Changes in cortisol levels were positively related to total body mass loss, while changes in TT3 levels were negatively related. While greater increases in BUN were related to greater rates of mass loss, the use of BUN levels as an indicator of metabolic state is complicated by the type and level of food intake. The observed changes in hormone levels support morphological data suggesting Steller sea lions may be more strongly impacted by short-term, reduced energy intake during winter than at other times of the year.},

abstract = {Muscle exercise correlates with oxygen use, tissue perfusion and heart rate (fH) in terrestrial animals, but the relationship between these physiological processes is less clear in diving animals. We found the mean heart rate of Steller sea lions trained to voluntarily dive to depths up to 40 m dropped by 40{\%} while diving, and noted that mean bradycardia was 9{\%} greater during shallow (10 m) compared to deep (40 m) dives. Longer dives resulted in lower heart rates, but only when they were shallow; on the other hand, minimum instantaneous fH decreased consistently with dive duration. In general, instantaneous fH did not reflect activity over short timescales. Our data suggest that our sea lions invoked a different dive response depending on whether they dove to shallow or deep depths. During shallow (10 m) dives only, the correlation between activity and fH was indicative of vascular compromise between diving and exercise. However, during deep dives (40 m), there was no such correlation, suggesting that locomotory activity was uncoupled from dive bradycardia, which was possibly mediated by an absence of blood flow to active muscle. For both diving scenarios, surface fH correlated with dive activity, suggesting that some underwater locomotory costs were deferred to the post-dive surface interval. Ultimately, our data support the speculation that Steller sea lion locomotory muscles become hypoxic during diving, regardless of dive depth.},

abstract = {The energy expenditure of free-living fur seals and sea lions is difficult to measure directly, but may be indirectly derived from flipper stroke rate. We filmed 10 captive otariids swimming with accelerometers either attached to a harness (Daily Diary: sampling frequency 32 Hz, N=4) or taped to the fur (G6a+: 25 Hz, N=6). We used down sampling to derive four recording rates from each accelerometer (Daily Diary: 32, 16, 8, 4 Hz; G6a+: 25, 20, 10, 5 Hz). For each of these sampling frequencies, we derived 20 combinations of two parameters (RMW, the window size used to calculate the running mean; and m, the minimum number of points smaller than a local maxima used to detect a peak) from the dynamic acceleration of x, z and x+z, to estimate stroke rate from the accelerometers. These estimates differed by up to ∼20{\%} in comparison to the actual number of foreflipper strokes counted from videos. RMW and the choice of axis used to make the calculations (x, z or x+z) had little effect on the overall differences, though the variability was reduced when using x+z. The best m varied depending on the axis used and the sampling frequency; a larger m was needed for higher sampling frequencies. This study demonstrates that when parameters are appropriately tuned, accelerometers are a simple yet valid tool for estimating the stroke rates of swimming otariids.},

abstract = {Nine Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) aged 1.75–6 yr were experimentally fasted for 7–14 d during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons to identify changes in plasma metabolites that are indicative of fasting and to determine whether the ability of sea lions to fast varies seasonally or with age. Although some animals approached the limit of their protein‐sparing ability by the end of our fasting experiments, there was no sign of irreversible starvation biochemistry. Plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations decreased in all animals within the first week of fasting, reflecting a shift to a fasting‐adapted state; however, significant increases in plasma BUN concentration at the end of the nonbreeding season fasts suggest that subadult Steller sea lions were not able to maintain a protein‐sparing metabolism for a full 14 d during the nonbreeding season. In contrast, juveniles were able to enter protein sparing sooner during the nonbreeding season when they had slightly higher initial percent total body lipid stores than during the breeding season. Subadult and juvenile sea lions had low circulating ketone body concentrations compared with young sea lion pups, suggesting an age‐related difference in how body reserves are utilized during fasting or how the resulting metabolites are circulated and catabolized. Our data suggest that metabolite concentrations from a single blood sample cannot be used to accurately predict the duration of fast; however, threshold metabolite concentrations may still be useful for assessing whether periods of fasting in the wild are unusually long compared with those normally experienced.},

abstract = {The Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) is listed as endangered in parts of its range and is suspected of suffering from ecological stressors that may be reflected by fecal glucocorticoid hormones. We validated a fecal glucocorticoid assay for this species with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Feces were collected from captive Steller sea lions (two males and two females) for 2 days before injection with ACTH, and for 4 or more days postinjection. Feces were freeze-dried, extracted with a methanol vortex method, and assayed for glucocorticoids. The assay demonstrated good parallelism and accuracy. All animals showed the expected peak of fecal glucocorticoid excretion after ACTH injection. However, the two males had higher baselines, higher peaks, and more delayed peaks than the females. Peak glucocorticoid excretion occurred at 5 and 28 h postinjection for the two females, and at 71 and 98 h for the two males. Correction for recoveries by the addition of tritiated hormones produced ACTH profiles that were virtually identical in pattern to uncorrected data, but with higher within-sample coefficients of variation. Based on these results, we conclude that this fecal glucocorticoid assay accurately reflects endogenous adrenal activity of Steller sea lions, and that recovery corrections are not necessary for this species when using the methanol vortex extraction method. More research is needed to address possible sex differences and other possible influences on fecal glucocorticoid concentrations.},

abstract = { Foraging theory predicts that animals should proportionately increase their food intake to compensate for re-  duced food energy content and (or) prey availability. However, the theoretical intake levels will, at some point, exceed  the digestive capacity of the predator. We tested the ability of Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus (Schreber, 1776), to  compensate for short-term changes in prey energy density and availability, and quantified the maximum amount of food  a young sea lion could consume. Five 1–2-year-old captive Steller sea lions were offered either herring (high energy)  or capelin (low energy) each day or every second day. When prey were available on a daily basis, the sea lions com-  pensated for differences in the energy content of herring and capelin by consuming sufficient quantities of each (8.3 vs.  14.0 kg{\textperiodcentered}d–1, respectively) to maintain equivalent gross energy intakes. When herring was available only on alternate  days, the sea lions increased their consumption by 52{\%} to 11.5 kg{\textperiodcentered}d–1, which was not sufficient to maintain an average  gross intake equal to that maintained when herring was available every day. When capelin was available only on alter-  nate days, some animals increased their intake for a few days, but average intake (15.2 kg{\textperiodcentered}d–1) was far below levels  observed during daily feeding. Generally, the sea lions appeared to reach their digestive limit at a level equivalent to  14{\%}–16{\%} of their body mass. Our findings suggest that Steller sea lions can alter their food intake in response to  short-term changes in prey quality or availability, but that these variables can quickly combine to necessitate food in-  take levels that exceed the physiological digestive capacities of young animals.  },

abstract = {Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) has been proposed as a technique for determining the long-term diet of animals. The method compares the fatty acid (FA) profiles of predators and potential prey items to estimate relative prey intake. We tested the assumptions of a key step in QFASA, the correction of predator FA signatures for metabolic processes through sets of calibration coefficients (CCs). We conducted long-term controlled feeding studies with cap- tive Steller sea lions consuming herring and eulachon and northern fur seals consuming herring. We compared the results with data from harbour seals eating herring to evaluate the effects of phylogeny and prey type on individual CCs. Even within the limited extended dietary FA subset recommended for use by other researchers, we found that at least 41{\%} of the CCs differed by family (otariid vs. phocid seals) and 58{\%} differed by predator species (sea lion vs. fur seal), sug- gesting that CCs may be highly species-specific. We also found that 64{\%} of the CCs differed by prey type (sea lions consuming herring vs. eulachon), which raises some fundamental implemen- tation issues. We also found significant differences in diet predictions when the herring- and eulachon-derived sets of CCs were applied to an actual multi-species diet. CCs are presently used as a simple mathematical attempt to describe potentially complex biochemistry. The results of this study raise questions regarding the validity of using CCs derived from an alternative predator species, and highlight some fundamental issues regarding QFASA methodology that need to be addressed through further controlled studies.},

abstract = {Diving animals must endeavor to increase their dive depths and prolong the time they spend exploiting resources at depth. Results from captive and wild studies suggest that many diving animals extend their foraging bouts by decreasing their metabolisms while submerged. We measured metabolic rates of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) trained to dive to depth in the open ocean to investigate the relationships between diving behaviour and the energetic costs of diving. We also constructed a general linear model to predict the oxygen consumption of sea lions diving in the wild. The resultant model suggests that swimming distance and depth of dives significantly influence the oxygen consumption of diving Steller sea lions. The predictive power of the model was tested using a cross-validation approach, whereby models reconstructed using data from pairs of sea lions were found to accurately predict the oxygen consumption of the third diving animal. Predicted oxygen consumption during dives to depth ranged from 3.37 L min␣ 1 at 10 m, to 1.40 L min␣ 1 at 300 m over a standardized swimming distance of 600 m. This equated to an estimated metabolic rate of 97.54 and 40.52 MJ day␣1, and an estimated daily feeding requirement of 18.92 and 7.96 kg day␣1 for dives between 10 and 300 m, respectively. The model thereby provides information on the potential energetic consequences that alterations in foraging strategies due to changes in prey availability could have on wild populations of sea lions.},

abstract = {Controlled feeding experiments were undertaken with captive Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) to assess seasonal (winter vs. summer) physiological responses of individual animals to reduced quantities and qualities of food that are hypothesised to occur in the wild. Eight animals were randomly divided into two experimental groups fed isocaloric diets: Group H ate Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) throughout the experiment while Group P was switched to walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) during a 28-day food restriction (after a 28-day baseline) and back to herring during a 28-day controlled re-feeding. Diet type did not impact the rates of body mass lost when food was restricted, but did influence the type of internal energy reserve (protein vs. lipids) the sea lions predominantly used. In both summer and winter, Group H lost significantly more lipids and less lean mass than Group P that was fed pollock during the restriction phase. The response of Group H was consistent with the predicted pattern of nutritional stress physiology (i.e. protein sparing and utilization of lipid reserves). Group P lost a surprisingly high proportion of body protein while consuming restricted levels of pollock, which could lead to muscle impairment and vital organ failure on a long-term basis. When given increased amounts of herring during the controlled re-feeding phase, the capacity of both groups to compensate for the previous mass loss was found to depend on season and was independent of previous diet. All of the sea lions increased their rates of mass gain and returned to their pre-experimental weight during winter, but not during summer. Some intrinsic energetic plasticity related to seasonal adaptation to the environment may render winter an easier period than summer to recover from nutritional stress.},

PVC tubes  were attached to harnesses worn by Steller sea lions that had been trained to feed at fixed depths (10  to 30m) and to resurface inside a metabolic dome. Buoyancy was altered to simulate the naturally  occurring differences in body composition reported in adult females ({\~{}}12 to 26{\%} subcutaneous fat).  Diving characteristics (transit times and time at depth) and aerobic energy expenditure (gas  exchange) were measured. We found that foraging cost decreased with the duration of the dive and  increased with dive depth. However, changes in body composition did not affect the diving metabolic  rate of Steller sea lions for dives between 10 and 30 m. We propose that Steller sea lions may adjust  their diving lung volume to compensate for changes in buoyancy to avoid additional metabolic costs. },

abstract = {Physiological responses to changes in energy balance are tightly regulated by the endocrine system through glucocorticoids, IGF-I and thyroid hormones. Changes in these hormones were studied in eight captive female Steller sea lions that experienced changes in food intake, body mass, body composition, and blood metabolites during summer and winter. During a period of energy restriction, one group of sea lions was fed reduced amounts of Pacific herring and another was fed an isocaloric diet of walleye pollock, after which both groups returned to their pre-experimental diets of herring. Cortisol was negatively and IGF-I was positively associated with changes in body mass during periods of energy restriction (mass loss associated with increase in cortisol and decrease in IGF-I) and refeeding (body mass maintenance associated with stable hormone concentrations in summer and compensatory growth linked to decrease in cortisol and increase in IGF-I in winter). Cortisol and IGF-I were also correlated with changes in lipid and lean mass, respectively. Consequently, these two hormones likely make adequate biomarkers for nutritional stress in sea lions, and when combined provide indication of the energetic strategy (lipid vs lean mass catabolism) animals adopt to cope with changes in nutrient intake. Unlike type of diet fed to the sea lions, age of the animals also impacted hormonal responses, with younger animals showing more intense hormonal changes to nutritional stress. Thyroid hormones, however, were not linked to any physiological changes observed in this study.},

abstract = {The metabolic costs of foraging and the management of O2 and CO2 stores during breath-hold diving was investigated in three female Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) trained to dive between 10 and 50 m (N=1142 dives). Each trial consisted of two to eight dives separated by surface intervals that were determined by the sea lion (spontaneous trials) or by the researcher (conditioned trials). During conditioned trials, surface intervals were long enough for O2 to return to pre-dive levels between each dive. The metabolic cost of each dive event (dive+surface interval; DMR) was measured using flow-through respirometry. The respiratory exchange ratio (VO2/VCO2) was significantly lower during spontaneous trials compared with conditioned trials. DMR was significantly higher during spontaneous trials and decreased exponentially with dive duration. A similar decrease in DMR was not as evident during conditioned trials. DMR could not be accurately estimated from the surface interval (SI) following individual dives that had short SIs ({\textless}50 s), but could be estimated on a dive by dive basis for longer SIs ({\textgreater}50 s). DMR decreased by 15{\%}, but did not differ significantly from surface metabolic rates (MRS) when dive duration increased from 1 to 7 min. Overall, these data suggest that DMR is almost the same as MRS, and that Steller sea lions incur an O2 debt during spontaneous diving that is not repaid until the end of the dive bout. This has important consequences in differentiating between the actual and `apparent' metabolic rate during diving, and may explain some of the differences in metabolic rates reported in pinniped species.},

abstract = {Estimates of energy expenditure for free-ranging animals are essential to answering a range of fundamental questions in animal biology, but are challenging to obtain and difficult to validate. We simultaneously employed three methods to measure the energy expenditure of 6 captive female northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) during 5-day trials across 4 seasons: respirometry (oxygen consumption), doubly labeled water (DLW), and accelerometry. The DLW method estimated that the fur seals expended 13.1 ± 16.5{\%} more energy than indicat- ed by the more direct measures of oxygen consumption. Accelerometry failed to predict the average mass- specific rate of oxygen consumption (V ̇ O2DEE ) within the individual seasons over entire 5-day trials. However, on a finer time scale (15 or 60 min) and adjusted for time of day, accelerometry estimated energy expenditure within an average difference of 5.4 ± 29.3{\%} (60 min intervals) and 13.8 ± 39.5{\%} (15 min intervals) of respirom- etry measured values. Our findings suggest that accelerometers have the potential to be more effective than the DLW method for measuring energy expenditure of free-ranging animals. However, rates of oxygen consumption varied with season, independent of overall activity. Seasonal effects (and time of day for accelerometry) must therefore be accounted for when estimating energy expenditure from measures of DLW and acceleration of free-swimming northern fur seals. Such corrections required for estimating energy expenditures in northern fur seals have implications for using accelerometers and DLW to estimate the energy expenditure of other species.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of diving metabolic rate are central to assessing the energy needs of marine mammals. To circumvent some of the limitations inherent with conducting energy studies in both the wild and captivity, we measured diving oxygen consumption of two trained Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the open ocean. The animals dived to predetermined depths (5–30 m) for controlled periods of time (50–200 s). Rates of oxygen consumption were measured using open-circuit respirometry before and after each dive. Mean resting rates of oxygen consumption prior to the dives were 1.34 (±0.18) and 1.95 (±0.19) liter/min for individual sea lions. Mean rates of oxygen consumption during the dives were 0.71 (±0.24) and 1.10 (±0.39) liter/min, respectively. Overall, rates of oxygen consumption during dives were significantly lower (45{\%} and 41{\%}) than the corresponding rates measured before dives. These results provide the first estimates of diving oxygen consumption rate for Steller sea lions and show that this species can exhibit a marked decrease in oxygen consumption relative to surface rates while submerged. This has important consequences in the evaluation of physiological limitations associated with diving such as dive duration and subsequent interpretations of diving behavior in the wild.},

Isotopic analysis of vibrissae (whiskers) is a potentially useful approach to resolving the nutritional ecology of this species because long-term (up to 8 yr) dietary information is sequentially recorded and metabolically inert once formed.

However, diet reconstruction using isotopic techniques requires {\textless}i{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/i{\textgreater} knowledge of trophic enrichment factors (TEFs), which can vary relative to diet quality and among animal species. In this study, we provide new TEF estimates for (1) maternal relative to pup vibrissae during both gestation and nursing and (2) adult vibrissae relative to a complex diet. Further, we refine vibrissa-milk TEFs based on an additional 76 animals with an age distribution ranging from 1 to 20 mo.

In an effort to expand these methods to pinnipeds, ASSRs elicited by single and multiple simultaneous tones were used to measure aerial hearing thresholds in several California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). There were no significant differences between thresholds measured using the single and multiple ASSR methods, despite the more rapid nature of data collection using the multiple ASSR method. There was a high degree of variability in ASSR thresholds among subjects; thresholds covered a range of {\~{}}40 dB at each tested frequency. As expected, ASSR thresholds were elevated relative to previously reported psychophysical thresholds for California and Steller sea lions. The features of high-frequency hearing limit and relative sensitivity of most ASSR audiograms were, however, similar to those of psychophysical audiograms, suggesting that ASSR methods can be used to improve understanding of hearing demographics in sea lions, especially with respect to high-frequency hearing. Thresholds for one Steller sea lion were substantially elevated relative to all other subjects, demonstrating that ASSR methods can be used to detect hearing loss in sea lions.},

abstract = {Transit costs associated with commuting between resting sites ashore and foraging areas at sea constitute an appreciable portion of foraging expenditures in pinnipeds. We examined transit swimming in 3 Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus trained to follow a moving boat at different speeds and depths. We measured dive behavior (duration) and focused specifically on activity measures (fore-flipper stroking and overall dynamic body acceleration [ODBA], an overall measure of body motion), which may be proxies for metabolic expenditure. Sea lions appeared to increase efficiency while transiting at depths that approached 3 times their body diameters (mean depth = 151 ± 1 cm SEM, n = 87). Although the response was not uniform for all tested scenarios, all of the observed significant adjustments to dive behavior and swimming mechanics supported an increased efficiency at this depth. An increase in transit speed (4.5 versus 3.5 knots [kn] surface speed) was associated with elevated flipper stroke frequencies (+5{\%}) and stroke output (ODBA stroke–1, +48{\%}). Sea lions transiting against the flow of a tidal current had reduced dive durations (–10{\%}), while total ODBA was consistently elevated (+8{\%} overall). This response to tidal flow was accompanied either by elevated ODBA stroke–1 (3.5 kn) or a parallel increase in stroking (4.5 kn). Our data demonstrate that small changes in the physical environment affect transiting in Steller sea lions, and imply that altered prey fields or changing ocean conditions can carry energetic consequences.},

abstract = {Three Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatuswere trained to participate in free-swim-  ming, open-ocean experiments designed to determine if activity can be used to estimate the ener-  getic cost of finding prey at depth. Sea lions were trained to dive to fixed depths of 10 to 50 m, and to  re-surface inside a floating dome to measure energy expenditure via gas exchange. A 3-axis  accelerometer was attached to the sea lions during foraging. Acceleration data were used to deter-  mine the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), a proxy for activity. Results showed that ODBA  correlated well with the diving metabolic rate (dive + surface interval) and that the variability in the  relationship (r2 = 0.47, linear regression including Sea lion as a random factor) was similar to that  reported for other studies that used heart rate to estimate metabolic rate for sea lions swimming  underwater in a 2 m deep water channel. A multivariate analysis suggested that both ODBA and dive  duration were important for predicting diving metabolic cost, but ODBA alone predicted foraging  cost to within 7{\%} between animals. Consequently, collecting 3-dimensional acceleration data is a  simple technique to estimate field metabolic rate of wild Steller sea lions and other diving mammals  and birds.  },

Captive feeding trials were used to further test the technique with newly weaned harbour seals Phoca vitulina richardsi (N = 21). Two groups of seals were fed monotypic diets of either Pacific herring Clupea pallasii or surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus for 42 d while a third group was fed smelt for 21 d followed by herring for 21 d. Blubber biopsies were taken dorsally at Days 0, 21 and 42. Specific calibration coefficients (CC) used by QFASA were developed from 4 juvenile harbour seals and in some cases differed by 2-fold with previously reported phocid CC values. The QFASA diet estimates were evaluated using 2 CC sets, 15 FA subsets and a library of 3 to 11 potential prey species. Diet switches were best tracked using the harbour seal CC and the new FA subset. Overall prey misclassifications were apparent (mean = 12{\%}, range = 4 to 25{\%}) when modeled with 8 additional prey not fed, a trend consistent with overlapping prey FA signatures. Blubber FA turnover rates were not strictly linear and in the order of 1.5 to 3 mo in newly weaned seals. Following parameter optimization of the model, QFASA estimates reflected major diet trends in the feeding study, but were sensitive to the CC and FA subsets used as well as to prey spe- cies with similar FA signatures. Our results have important implications in the application of QFASA to the study of pinniped diets with more complex feeding histories and wider prey fields.},

abstract = {Populations of at least 20 asteroid species on the Northeast Pacific Coast have recently experienced an extensive outbreak of sea-star (asteroid) wasting disease (SSWD). The disease leads to behavioral changes, lesions, loss of turgor, limb autotomy, and death characterized by rapid degradation ("melting"). Here, we present evidence from experimental challenge studies and field observations that link the mass mortalities to a densovirus (Parvoviridae). Virus-sized material (i.e., {\textless}0.2 $\mu$m) from symptomatic tissues that was inoculated into asymptomatic asteroids consistently resulted in SSWD signs whereas animals receiving heat-killed (i.e., control) virus-sized inoculum remained asymptomatic. Viral metagenomic investigations revealed the sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV) as the most likely candidate virus associated with tissues from symptomatic asteroids. Quantification of SSaDV during transmission trials indicated that progression of SSWD paralleled increased SSaDV load. In field surveys, SSaDV loads were more abundant in symptomatic than in asymptomatic asteroids. SSaDV could be detected in plankton, sediments and in nonasteroid echinoderms, providing a possible mechanism for viral spread. SSaDV was detected in museum specimens of asteroids from 1942, suggesting that it has been present on the North American Pacific Coast for at least 72 y. SSaDV is therefore the most promising candidate disease agent responsible for asteroid mass mortality.},

abstract = {As upper-level predatory fishes become overfished, mesopredators rise to become the new 'top' predators of over-exploited marine communities. To gain insight into ensuing mechanisms that might alter indirect species interactions, we examined how behavioural responses to an upper-level predatory fish might differ between mesopredator species with different life histories. In rocky reefs of the northeast Pacific Ocean, adult lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are upper-level predators that use a sit-and-wait hunting mode. Reef mesopredators that are prey to adult lingcod include kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), younger lingcod, copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and quillback rockfish (S. maliger). Across these mesopredators species, longevity and age at maturity increases and, consequently, the annual proportion of lifetime reproductive output decreases in the order just listed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of risk taken to acquire resources would vary interspecifically in that same order. During field experiments we manipulated predation risk with a model adult lingcod and used fixed video cameras to quantify interactions between mesopredators and tethered prey (Pandalus shrimps). We predicted that the probabilities of inspecting and attacking tethered prey would rank from highest to lowest and the timing of these behaviours would rank from earliest to latest as follows: kelp greenling, lingcod, copper rockfish, and quillback rockfish. We also predicted that responses to the model lingcod, such as avoidance of interactions with tethered prey, would rank from weakest to strongest in the same order. Results were consistent with our predictions suggesting that, despite occupying similar trophic levels, longer-lived mesopredators with late maturity have stronger antipredator responses and therefore experience lower foraging rates in the presence of predators than mesopredators with faster life histories. The corollary is that the fishery removal of top predators, which relaxes predation risk, could potentially lead to stronger increases in foraging rates for mesopredators with slower life histories.},

abstract = {Top-down control of community structure can manifest as inverse relationships between the abundances of organisms at adjacent trophic levels. Due to the time costs of handling very large prey it may be optimal for gape-limited predatory fishes to select prey with body depths that are less than or equal to 60{\%} of predator gape width. We tested for inverse relationships between the abundances of different sized rockfish (prey) and of lingcod (predator) large enough to be expected to select that rockfish size. We predicted that these relationships would be stronger when assuming that body depth of selected prey is less than or equal to 60{\%}, rather than less than or equal to 100{\%}, of lingcod gape width. Results were consistent with this prediction for small and medium size classes of rockfish. Regardless of prey selection assumptions there were no negative relationships between lingcod and large size classes of rockfish, possibly because only 2.3{\%} of observed lingcod were large enough to select large rockfish when assuming prey body depth selection of less than or equal to 60{\%} of predator gape width. Large rockfish, therefore, may have occupied a size refuge from lingcod risk. Our results, however, are characterized by large statistical uncertainty. We suggest that prey antipredator behaviour, which has the cost of reducing access to resources and the benefit of lowering mortality rates, might explain much of this uncertainty. Quillback and copper rockfish are long-lived species with late maturity. As such, they are expected to maximize fitness by investing heavily in antipredator behaviour, and this investment may have weakened numerical relationships between lingcod and small and medium size classes.},

In the laboratory, spawning of A. taylori in the absence of E. bison nests was observed to occur adjacent to eggs of another sculpin, Icelinus borealis, but no spawning of A. taylori was observed in the field in association with nests of any fish other than E. bison. The E. bison male guards the composite cluster of egg masses, and the A. taylori eggs hatch faster than the earlier laid E. bison eggs. Enophrys bison embryonic development appears retarded by overlying A. taylori eggs so the spawning by A. taylori on E. bison egg masses is a form of nesting parasitism, a behavior previously unknown among marine fishes. This study is the first report of interspecific nesting for marine fishes.},

We measured spatio-temporal variation in the relative abundance of lingcod, subadult rockfish and two shrimp groups eaten by rockfish (Pandalus sp. and three smaller-bodied genera aggregated). Lingcod had an indirect positive effect on shrimps, as mediated by the direct negative effects of lingcod on rockfish and of rockfish on shrimps. These top-down effects on shrimps, however, were stronger for Pandalus than for small-bodied shrimps. Further, abundances of Pandalus and small-bodied shrimps were negatively correlated and the latter had a stronger positive effect on rockfish, suggesting that rockfish mediated asymmetrical apparent competition between shrimps.

Archival satellite transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally into three stranded Pacific harbor seal pups (Phoca vitulina richardii) that completed rehabilitation, to evaluate the viability of this surgical technique for the deployment of life long telemetry devices in phocids. The life history transmitters record information throughout the life of the host and transmit data to orbiting satellites after extrusion following death. Surgeries were performed under general anesthesia and a single transmitter was inserted into the ventrocaudal abdominal cavity via a 7–8 cm incision along the ventral midline between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis or preputial opening in each animal. Surgeries lasted from 45 to 51 min, and anesthesic times ranged from 55 to 79 min. All animals recovered well, were released into dry holding pens overnight, and were given access to water the following day. All three animals exhibited an expected inflammatory response, with acute phase responses lasting approximately three to four weeks. All three animals were tracked via externally attached satellite transmitters after release at 58 to 78 days following surgery, and minimum post-release survival was confirmed through continued movement data received over 278 to 289 days. The initial findings of low morbidity and zero mortality encountered during captive observation and post-release tracking periods support the viability of this surgical technique for the implantation of long-term telemetry devices in phocids.},

In this study, we use data from 26 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences (988bp) to test a priori hypotheses about population subdivisions generated from a decade of killer whale surveys across the northern North Pacific. A total of 462 remote skin biopsies were collected from wild killer whales primarily between 2001 and 2010 from the northern Gulf of Alaska to the Sea of Okhotsk, representing both the piscivorous "resident" and the mammal-eating "transient" (or Bigg's) killer whales. Divergence of the 2 ecotypes was supported by both mtDNA and microsatellites. Geographic patterns of genetic differentiation were supported by significant regions of genetic discontinuity, providing evidence of population structuring within both ecotypes and corroborating direct observations of restricted movements of individual whales. In the Aleutian Islands (Alaska), subpopulations, or groups with significantly different mtDNA and microsatellite allele frequencies, were largely delimited by major oceanographic boundaries for resident killer whales. Although Amchitka Pass represented a major subdivision for transient killer whales between the central and western Aleutian Islands, several smaller subpopulations were evident throughout the eastern Aleutians and Bering Sea. Support for seasonally sympatric transient subpopulations around Unimak Island suggests isolating mechanisms other than geographic distance within this highly mobile top predator.},

abstract = {Although killer whale, Orcinus orca, dialects have been studied in detail in several populations, little attempt has been made to compare dialect characteristics between populations. In this study we investigated geographical variation in monophonic and biphonic calls among four resident populations from the North Pacific Ocean: Northern and Southern residents from British Columbia and Washington State, southern Alaska residents, and eastern Kamchatka residents. We tested predictions generated by the hypothesis that call variation across populations is the result of an accumulation of random errors and innovation by vertical cultural transmission. Call frequency contours were extracted and compared using a dynamic time-warping algorithm. We found that the diversity of monophonic calls was substantially higher than that of biphonic calls for all populations. Repertoire diversity appeared to be related to population size: in larger populations, monophonic calls were more diverse and biphonic calls less diverse. We suggest that the evolution of both monophonic and biphonic calls is caused by an interaction between stochastic processes and directional selection, but the relative effect of directional selection is greater for biphonic calls. Our analysis revealed no direct correlation between call repertoire similarity and geographical distance. Call diversity within predefined call categories, types and subtypes, showed a high degree of correspondence between populations. Our results indicate that dialect evolution is a complex process influenced by an interaction among directional selection, horizontal transmission and founder effects. We suggest several scenarios for how this might have arisen and the implications of these scenarios for call evolution and population history.},

abstract = {The pulmonary system is a common site for bacterial infections in cetaceans, but very little is known about their respiratory microbiome. We used a small, unmanned hexacopter to collect exhaled breath condensate (blow) from two geographically distinct populations of apparently healthy humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), sampled in the Massachusetts coastal waters off Cape Cod (n = 17) and coastal waters around Vancouver Island (n = 9). Bacterial and archaeal small-subunit rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced from blow samples, including many of sparse volume, as well as seawater and other controls, to characterize the associated microbial community. The blow microbiomes were distinct from the seawater microbiomes and included 25 phylogenetically diverse bacteria common to all sampled whales. This core assemblage comprised on average 36{\%} of the microbiome, making it one of the more consistent animal microbiomes studied to date. The closest phylogenetic relatives of 20 of these core microbes were previously detected in marine mammals, suggesting that this core microbiome assemblage is specialized for marine mammals and may indicate a healthy, noninfected pulmonary system. Pathogen screening was conducted on the microbiomes at the genus level, which showed that all blow and few seawater microbiomes contained relatives of bacterial pathogens; no known cetacean respiratory pathogens were detected in the blow. Overall, the discovery of a shared large core microbiome in humpback whales is an important advancement for health and disease monitoring of this species and of other large whales. IMPORTANCE The conservation and management of large whales rely in part upon health monitoring of individuals and populations, and methods generally necessitate invasive sampling. Here, we used a small, unmanned hexacopter drone to noninvasively fly above humpback whales from two populations, capture their exhaled breath (blow), and examine the associated microbiome. In the first extensive examination of the large-whale blow microbiome, we present surprising results about the discovery of a large core microbiome that was shared across individual whales from geographically separated populations in two ocean basins.

abstract = {A few species of mammals produce group-specific vocalisations that are passed on by learning, but the function of learned vocal variation remains poorly understood. Resident killer whales live in stable matrilineal groups with repertoires of seven to 17 stereotyped call types. Some types are shared among matrilines, but their structure typically shows matriline-specific differences. Our objective was to analyse calls of nine killer whale matrilines in British Columbia to test whether call similarity primarily reflects social or genetic relationships. Recordings were made in 1985-1995 in the presence of focal matrilines that were either alone or with groups with non-overlapping repertoires. We used neural network discrimination performance to measure the similarity of call types produced by different matrilines and determined matriline association rates from 757 encounters with one or more focal matrilines. Relatedness was measured by comparing variation at 11 microsatellite loci for the oldest female in each group. Call similarity was positively correlated with association rates for two of the three call types analysed. Similarity of the N4 call type was also correlated with matriarch relatedness. No relationship between relatedness and association frequency was detected. These results show that call structure reflects relatedness and social affiliation, but not because related groups spend more time together. Instead, call structure appears to play a role in kin recognition and shapes the association behaviour of killer whale groups. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that increasing social complexity plays a role in the evolution of learned vocalisations in some mammalian species.},

This study investigates their exposure to exhaust gases from whale-watching vessels by using a simple dispersion model incorporating data on whale and vessel behavior, atmospheric conditions, and output of airborne pollutants from the whale-watching fleet based on emissions data from regulatory agencies. Our findings suggest that current whale-watching guidelines are usually effective in limiting pollutant exposure to levels at or just below those at which measurable adverse health effects would be expected in killer whales. However, safe pollutant levels are exceeded under worst-case conditions and certain average-case conditions. To reduce killer whale exposure to exhaust we recommend: vessels position on the downwind side of whales, a maximum of 20 whale-watching vessels should be within 800 m at any given time, viewing periods should be limited, and current whale-watch guidelines and laws should be enforced.},

abstract = {Acoustic communication is central to the socio-ecology of cetaceans. Knowledge of the ontogeny of their extensive repertoires is scant, and even less is known about the role of learning in vocal development. To examine these issues, the development of calls of one male beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) calls was systematically studied at the Vancouver Aquarium throughout his first year of life and opportunistically through his second and third years. He vocalized within the first hour after birth, producing exclusively low energy, broadband pulse trains. Both the dominant frequency and the pulse repetition rate of the pulsed calls increased with age. He acquired rudimentary whistles at 2 wks of age. During the second month, whistle production increased substantially. Whistle dominant frequency tended to increase with age, and at least in his first year, whistles did not attain full stereotypy. The calf started using mixed call types consistently at 4mo. While some sounds tended to be more variable at later ages, his mixed calls progressively lost variability and increasingly resembled his mother's most predominant stereotyped mixed call type. By 20 mo, this call type was fully stereotyped. Six months after he was exposed to his father's sounds, he incorporated one of his father's call types into his repertoire. These findings are discussed in light of current theories of sound production mechanisms in odontocetes, developmental stages of vocal acquisition, and vocal learning.},

abstract = {Unlike terrestrial mammals that have unambiguous aerial sound transmission pathways via the outer ear and tympanum, sound reception pathways in most odontocetes are not well understood. Recent studies have used auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements to examine sound reception pathways. This study sought to determine how sound source placements, recording electrode arrangements, and ABR peak analyses affect interpretations of sound reception in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Click stimuli were delivered in air from a contact transducer ("jawphone"). Early ABR peaks (representing auditory nerve responses), and later peaks reflecting higher brainstem activity, were analyzed across jawphone and recording electrode positions. Auditory nerve responses were similar for jawphone placements from the ipsilateral posterior mandible to the tip of the rostrum. Later peaks, however, suggested a possible region of highest sensitivity midway between the posterior mandible and the rostrum tip. These findings are generally similar to previous data for porpoises. In contrast to auditory nerve responses that were largest when recorded near the ipsilateral meatus, later ABR peaks were largest when recorded with a contralateral (opposing) electrode. These results provide information on the processes underlying peaks of the ABR, and inform stimulus delivery and ABR recording parameters in odontocete sound reception studies.},

abstract = {As apex predators, killer whales Orcinus orca are expected to strongly influence the structure of marine communities by impacting the abundance, distribution, behavior, and evolution of their prey. Empirical assessments of these impacts are difficult, however, because killer whales are sparsely distributed, highly mobile, and difficult to observe. We present a 4 yr time series of observa- tions of foraging and feeding behavior of {\textgreater}150 transient killer whales that aggregate annually during the northbound migration of gray whales past Unimak Island, Alaska. Most predatory attacks were on gray whale Eschrichtius robustus calves or yearlings and were quickly abandoned if calves were aggressively defended by their mothers. Attacks were conducted by groups of 3 to 4 killer whales, which attempted to drown their prey. Gray whales generally tried to move into shallow water along the shoreline when attacked; if they succeeded in reaching depths of 3 m or less, attacks were aban- doned. Kills occurred in waters from 15 to 75 m deep or were moved into such areas after death. After some hours of feeding, the carcasses were usually left, but were re-visited and fed on by killer whales over several days. Carcasses or pieces of prey that floated onshore were actively consumed by brown bears Ursus arctos, and carcasses on the bottom were fed on by sleeper sharks Somniosus pacificus, apparently increasing the local density of both species},

The widespread occurrence of hybridization indicates that postmating barriers to interbreeding are incomplete within the order Cetacea, and therefore raises questions about how species integrity is maintained in the face of interspecific (and often intergeneric) gene flow. We examined hybridization across the order Cetacea (oceanic species included: N = 78; species with 44 chromosomes included: N = 52) to test for associations between the occurrence of hybridization and similarity across 13 ecological, morphological and behavioral traits in hybridizing vs. non-hybridizing species pairs. We found that species pairs that share a greater number of traits had a higher propensity to hybridize than pairs of species that did not. This trend was driven by behavioral and morphological traits such as vocalization frequency and body size. Together our findings suggest the importance of divergent selection on morphological and behavioral traits within sympatric species in constraining opportunities for hybridization and preventing the collapse of parental species.},

Here we report on the use of a small, unmanned hexacopter (APH-22; Aerial Imaging Solutions) as an alter-native method for collecting photographs to measure killer whales (Orcinus orca) at sea. We deployed and retrieved the hexacopter by hand during 60 flights (average duration 13.2 min, max 15.7 min) from the upper deck of an 8.2 m boat, utilizing the aircraft's vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability. The hexacopter was quiet and stable in flight, and therefore could be flown at relatively low altitudes without disturbing whales. The payload was a Micro Four-Thirds system camera that was used to obtain 18920 still images from an altitude of 35–40 m above the whales. Tests indicated a ground-resolved distance of {\textless}1.4 cm across the full extent of a flat and undistorted field of view, and an onboard pressure altimeter enabled measurements in pixels to be scaled to true size with an average accuracy of 5 cm. As a result, the images were sharp enough to differentiate individual whales using natural markings (77 whales in total) and preliminary estimates resolved differences in whale lengths ranging from 2.6 to 5.8 m. This first application at sea demonstrated the APH-22 hexacopter to be a safe and cost-effective platform for collecting photogrammetry images to fill key scientific data gaps about whales, and we anticipate this utility will extend to studies of other wildlife species.},

These records are the first of live Fin Whales in Queen Charlotte, Johnstone, Georgia and Juan De Fuca Straits and are also the only confirmed sightings between Vancouver Island and continental North America since 1930. Additionally, 12 dead Fin Whales all with evidence of ship strikes are reported in these waters between 1986 and 2017. Most (88{\%}) sightings of live Fin Whales occurred between July and October and no individuals were documented dead or alive between January and April.

abstract = {A key goal for wildlife managers is identifying discrete, demographically independent conservation units. Previous genetic work assigned killer whales that occur seasonally in the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) and killer whales sampled off the Canary Islands (CI) to the same population. Here we present new analyses of photo-identification and individual genotypes to assess the level of contemporary gene flow and migration between study areas, and analyses of biomarkers to assess ecological differences. We identified 47 different individuals from 5 pods in the SoG and 16 individuals in the CI, with no matches found between the areas. Mitochondrial DNA control region haplotype was shared by all individuals sampled within each pod, suggesting that pods have a matrifocal social structure typical of this species, whilst the lack of shared mitogenome haplotypes between the CI and SoG individuals suggests that there was little or no female migration between groups. Kinship analysis detected no close kin between CI and SoG individuals, and low to zero contemporary gene flow. Isotopic values and organochlorine pollutant loads also suggest ecological differences between study areas. We further found that one individual from a pod within the SoG not seen in association with the other four pods and identified as belonging to a potential migrant lineage by genetic analyses, had intermediate isotopic values and contaminant between the two study areas. Overall our results suggest a complex pattern of social and genetic structuring correlated with ecological variation. Consequently at least CI and SoG should be considered as two different management units. Understanding this complexity appears to be an important consideration when monitoring and understanding the viability of these management units. Understand the viability will help the conservation of these threatened management units.},

Despite inhabiting an isolated region far removed from industrial activities, these killer whales can presently be considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the southern hemisphere, with concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 20.5mg/kg lipid weight (lw). PCDD levels ranged from below the detection limit (5ng/kg) to 77.1ng/kglw and PCDF levels from below the detection limit (7ng/kg) to 36.1ng/kglw. Over 70{\%} of our study animals had PCB concentrations which exceeded a 1.3mg/kg PCB threshold established for endocrine disruption and immunotoxicity in free-ranging harbour seals, suggesting that organic contaminants cannot be ruled out as an additional threat to this declining population.},

abstract = {The ability to modify the structure and context of vocalizations through learning plays a key role in the social interactions of many species. The investigation of categorical matching, an aspect of contextual vocal learning, is the first step toward determining how contextual learning plays a role in the use, comprehension, and categorization of sounds in the wild. To this end, we conducted a study at the Vancouver Aquarium to test the ability of a juvenile female beluga, Qila, to respond to playbacks of two types of in-air beluga calls with vocalizations that matched the category of call played (a scream, which is a vocalization type shaped over time with reinforcement and not part of this species'natural repertoire, and a pulse-train, a natural call category). We first tested Qila with random sequences of the same version of the two vocalizations with which she had been trained. Her overall success in matching all playback stimuli was above chance but not statistically so (66{\%}). She had more difficulty matching screams (54{\%} success) than pulse trains (80{\%} success). We next played random sequences of six novel pulse-trains and seven novel screams, which Qila had not been trained with. She responded correctly to the set of novel stimuli of both call types in 64{\%} of the trials, a success rate that did not differ statistically from chance. Again, she had more difficulty matching screams (55{\%} success), relative to pulse trains (74{\%} success). These results indicate that Qila successfully matched only pulse trains, the class that is part of this species' natural repertoire. Her poor performance on matching screams might be partly explained by a difficulty to perceive categorically a signal that lacks a function in the natural repertoire of belugas.},

abstract = {We used variation at microsatellite loci and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to detect and quantify (1) hybridization between the harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena and the Dall's porpoises Phoconoides dalli and (2) the genetic population structure of harbour porpoises in British Columbia (BC), Canada. We assayed variation across 262 individuals (204 putative harbour, 44 putative Dall's, 9 putative hybrids, and 5 unidentified porpoises) obtained primarily from strandings and initially identified morphologically. Our assays identified 198 pure (probability {\textgreater}= 0.95) harbour porpoises, 37 pure Dall's porpoises, and 27 individuals of mixed ancestry, and we found that hybrids between the 2 species occurred over a larger geographic range than previously known. Analysis of 8 microsatellite loci was used to estimate a value of F-ST between the Strait of Georgia region and waters outside this area that was low and non-significant (FST = 0.0025, p {\textgreater} 0.25). Cluster-based Bayesian analysis of population structure in harbour porpoises suggested a single genetic population across our sample area. Within the harbour porpoise, there were 50 mtDNA haplotypes that differed from each other by an average of 0.015 substitutions per nucleotide site. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated that there was no significant divergence between the waters within and the waters outside the Strait of Georgia region (Phi(ST) = -0.022, p {\textgreater} 0.9). Our findings suggest that harbour porpoises inhabiting coastal waters of southern BC constitute a single genetic population, which should be reflected in management decisions. Our data also suggest that these management efforts should take into account occasional hybridization with sympatric Dall's porpoise.},

abstract = {Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are sighted regularly in coastal Alaska during the summer, but little is known about their movements through the area during the winter when weather and light limit the use of boat-based surveys. Acoustic monitor- ing provides a practical alternative because each extended resident killer whale family group or pod has a unique dialect that can be discerned by differences in their repertoires of stereotyped calls. The repertoires of resident killer whale pods in the northern Gulf of Alaska were updated from earlier studies, and the results used to determine the identity of pods that were recorded on remote hydrophones in Resurrection Bay, Alaska, in the fall, winter, and spring of 1999 to 2004. In total, seven pods of resident killer whales were identified acoustically, comprising four related pods from AB clan and three from AD clan. The frequencies of occurrence of the clans differed between the November to March recording period when AB clan occupied the area, and the April-May period when AD clan was predominant. The sequen- tial use of this habitat during periods of relative prey scarcity has the effect of limiting intergroup resource competition and is consistent with earlier findings that demonstrated divergent resource spe- cialization by sympatric killer whale populations.},

abstract = {The cosmopolitan killer whale Orcinus orca feeds on a wide variety of prey types over its global range, but in at least some regions, genetically distinct and ecologically specialised lineages of killer whales coexist sympatrically. In coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific, 2 such lineages have been well described: the so-called ‘residents' prey on teleost fish, especially salmonids and the other (‘transients') on marine mammals. A third lineage in this region (‘offshores') appears from chemical tracers to be ecologically distinct from residents and transients, but its diet is very poorly known. Here we describe 2 encounters with offshore killer whales during which multiple predation events involving sharks were observed. Using DNA analysis of tissue samples collected from these predation events, we identified the prey species as Pacific sleeper shark Somniosus pacificus and determined that a minimum of 16 individuals were consumed over the 2 encounters. This represents the first confirmed prey species of offshore killer whales based on field observations of foraging and the first record of any Somniosus species in the prey of Orcinus. We also show quantitatively that api- cal tooth wear is far greater in offshores than in resident and transient killer whales, and propose that such wear is at least in part due to abrasion from dermal denticles embedded in shark skin. Further studies are needed to determine whether offshore killer whales are as specialised ecologically as resident and transient killer whales, and whether sharks play a dominant role in their diet.},

abstract = {Odontocete sounds are produced by two pairs of phonic lips situated in soft nares below the blowhole; the right pair is larger and is more likely to produce clicks, while the left pair is more likely to produce whistles. This has important implications for the cultural evolution of delphinid sounds: the greater the physical constraints, the greater the probability of random convergence. In this paper the authors examine the call structure of eight killer whale populations to identify structural constraints and to determine if they are consistent among all populations. Constraints were especially pronounced in two-voiced calls. In the calls of all eight populations, the lower component of two-voiced (biphonic) calls was typically centered below 4 kHz, while the upper component was typically above that value. The lower component of two-voiced calls had a narrower frequency range than single-voiced calls in all populations. This may be because some single-voiced calls are homologous to the lower component, while others are homologous to the higher component of two-voiced calls. Physical constraints on the call structure reduce the possible variation and increase the probability of random convergence, producing similar calls in different populations.},

abstract = {The science of restoration ecology has advanced steadily since the 1970's, as concern about losses of biological diversity in terrestrial and freshwater habitats has grown. This has led to measures that offset the degradation or destruction of habitat by creating, enhancing, restoring or protecting compensatory areas. A second related conservation measure involves mitigating damage caused by one activity to compensate for damage caused by another. Carbon-trading operates on this transference principle. All are intended to ensure ‘no net loss' of ecosystem services.Similar precautionary measures could be used to manage anthropogenic underwater noise impacts on vulnerable marine mammals, fishes and invertebrates. These could be an alternative to, or in addition to, population consequences of disturbance models (PCOD), which are parameterized using expert-judgement. A compensatory approach would be most applicable to areas with substantial pre-existing anthropogenic noise, and would lead to decisions that en...},

abstract = {This study describes allonursing (females nursing offspring that are not their own) in captive belugas (Delphinapterus leucas). In addition to the calf's mother, two females that were not pregnant or nursing at the time of the calf's birth spontaneously lactated and nursed the male calf intermittently throughout 34 months of his life at the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Center. These observations suggest that allonursing may also take place in their wild counterparts and add to existing evidence of alloparental care in this species. Alloparental care, the care of nonoffspring, has been observed in every major mammalian taxon; the protection of calves through alloparental care may be a strong evolutionary benefit.},

abstract = {Contact calls are ubiquitous in social birds and mammals. Belugas are among the most vocal of cetaceans, but the function of their calls is poorly understood. In a previous study we hypothesized that a broad band pulsed call type labeled Type A, serves as a contact call between mothers and their calves. Here we examined context-specific use of call types recorded from a captive beluga social group at the Vancouver Aquarium, and found that the Type A call comprised 24{\%} to 97{\%} of the vocalizations during isolation, births, death of a calf, presence of external stressors, and re-union of animals after separation. In contrast it comprised 4.4{\%} of the vocalizations produced during regular sessions. We grouped 2835 Type A calls into five variants, A1 to A5. A discriminant function analysis classified 87{\%} of calls in the same groupings that we assigned them to by ear and visual examination of spectrograms. The variants do not represent individual signatures. One variant, A1, was used by three related individuals: an adult female, her male calf and his juvenile half-sister. Our previous research documented the gradual development of the A1 variant by the male calf, until at 20 months he was producing stereotyped renditions of his mother and sisters A1. We used our findings to generate testable predictions about the usage of these signals by wild belugas. We verified the existence of signals with the same distinctive features as the contact calls found in captivity in the repertoire of St. Lawrence Estuary herds, and documented their usage by two wild individuals from different populations. In the St. Lawrence, these were emitted by a female calling after a dead-calf. In Hudson Bay, by a temporarily restrained juvenile. We propose that these calls function in nature, as in captivity, to maintain group cohesion, and that the variants shared by related animals are used for mother-calf recognition.},

abstract = {Killer whale populations may differ in genetics, morphology, ecology, and behavior. In the North Pacific, two sympatric populations (“resident” and “transient”) specialize on different prey (fish and marine mammals) and retain reproductive isolation. In the eastern North Atlantic, whales from the same populations have been observed feeding on both fish and marine mammals. Fish-eating North Pacific “residents” are more genetically related to eastern North Atlantic killer whales than to sympatric mammal-eating “transients.” In this paper, a comparison of frequency variables in killer whale calls recorded from four North Pacific resident, two North Pacific transient, and two eastern North Atlantic populations is reported to assess which factors drive the large-scale changes in call structure. Both low-frequency and high-frequency components of North Pacific transient killer whale calls have significantly lower frequencies than those of the North Pacific resident and North Atlantic populations. The difference in frequencies could be related to ecological specialization or to the phylogenetic history of these populations. North Pacific transient killer whales may have genetically inherited predisposition toward lower frequencies that may shape their learned repertoires.V},
